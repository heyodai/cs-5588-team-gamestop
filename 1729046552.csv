2018-01-02,42.54,SELL,50,3177.0,1050,"Given my high risk tolerance, I'm concerned about Apple's challenges in the high-end smartphone market and the recent criticism over slowing down devices. Although Piper Jaffray analysts are bullish on Apple shares being in a 'super-long cycle', I think it's better to sell some shares to lock in profits before potential losses. With the article stating that global smartphone production will fall by 5% this year, I'm also worried about the impact on iPhone sales. Considering the mixed stock futures heading into the first trading day of 2018 and geopolitical concerns, I decide to sell 50 shares of AAPL to diversify my portfolio."

2018-01-04,43.13,SELL,20,2364.05,1070,"The recent discovery of Meltdown and Spectre security flaws in computer chips produced by Intel, AMD, and ARM Holdings could potentially affect Apple's stock price. Although AAPL has already received updates to fix the issue, the potential for hackers to steal sensitive information from nearly every modern computing device that uses these chips is a concern. I'm selling 20 shares to diversify my portfolio and reduce risk in light of this news."
2018-01-05,43.36,SELL,30,1100.0,1100,"Given the high risk tolerance and the fact that Apple has confirmed all Mac computers and iOS devices are affected by Meltdown and Spectre, I'm concerned about the security vulnerabilities which may lead to hackers and malware attacks. Therefore, I decide to sell some shares of AAPL in hopes of capturing a potential downturn in the stock price before the patch is released."
2018-01-08,43.59,SELL - Insufficient holdings,5,1100.0,1100,"Despite Apple's position as a leader in the tech industry, the articles highlight potential challenges and competitors that may impact its stock price. The focus on smartphone addiction in children and improving emergency dispatching systems could lead to regulatory scrutiny or public pressure, which might affect AAPL's stock price. Additionally, Google's growing hardware business and GN Store Nord's challenge to AirPods may erode Apple's market share. Given my high risk tolerance, I'm willing to sell 5 shares of AAPL to take advantage of potential short-term volatility."
2018-01-09,43.64,BUY,10,1526.38,1090,"I believe the concerns about young people getting addicted to iPhones may have a long-term negative impact on Apple's market value. Jana Partners and CalSTRS' calls for action may lead to increased scrutiny and regulatory pressure, potentially affecting AAPL's stock price. Given my high risk tolerance, I'm willing to take a position to capitalize on this potential trend."
2018-01-10,43.29,HOLD,0,1526.38,1090,"Given Apple's facing questions from government officials and investment advice suggesting caution, I'm choosing to sell my shares of AAPL despite its high portfolio risk tolerance. However, after reassessing the situation, I don't have enough information to determine a specific buy or sell volume. Therefore, I will keep my current 10 shares."
2018-01-11,43.65,HOLD,0,1526.38,1090,"With a high portfolio risk tolerance and considering various market factors, I'm choosing to hold my shares of AAPL for now. While some points suggest potential challenges for Apple, such as iPhone demand being weak and security flaws affecting the industry, others highlight opportunities like Apple's services revenue growth and the company's expansion into new markets."
2018-01-12,44.04,BUY - Insufficient funds,90,1526.38,1090,"Based on the latest news, I believe Apple's expanding original content portfolio and the growing demand for its products will drive the stock price up. Additionally, the Dow Jones index has shown resilience lately, and with the new German government, S&P 500 futures are expected to rally. While there is a risk that corporations may dodge billions in US taxes through new loopholes, I believe Apple's strong brand value and financial position will mitigate this risk. Considering my high portfolio risk tolerance, I'm willing to take a moderate gamble on AAPL's stock price rising by at least 14% as predicted by some analysts."
2018-01-16,44.47,HOLD,0,1526.38,1090,"Given my high risk tolerance, I don't have enough information to make a decision. The news articles provide some context, but they also raise concerns that could potentially impact AAPL's stock price in either direction. I'll hold onto my existing shares and wait for more concrete signals before making any further decisions."
2018-01-17,44.04,SELL - Insufficient holdings,20,1526.38,1090,"Given my high risk tolerance and current valuation of $1526.37501 per share, I believe that Apple's stock price is due for a correction. The recent surge in stock price and the downgrade of AAPL stock suggest that the market may be overestimating its value. Additionally, the allegations of poor working conditions in China could potentially impact Apple's supply chain and profitability. As such, I will sell 20 shares to lock in some profits and adjust my portfolio accordingly."
2018-01-18,44.84,HOLD,0,1526.38,1090,"Given my high portfolio risk tolerance and current share value of $1526.37501, I choose to hold onto my existing 10 shares of AAPL. The potential for increased economic impact and jobs from Apple's domestic investments may provide long-term benefits, but the news about iPhone battery problems and security exploits raises some concerns that could affect short-term performance."
2018-01-19,44.65,HOLD,0,1526.38,1090,"The information provided is mostly focused on potential negative factors that could impact Apple's stock price, such as the South Korean consumer group's complaint and concerns about iPhone X demand waning. However, it's also mentioned that companies are using artificial intelligence to improve their operations and competitiveness, which could be a positive trend for AAPL. Given my high portfolio risk tolerance, I'm inclined to hold onto my shares for now."
2018-01-22,44.33,SELL - Insufficient holdings,20,1526.38,1090,"Considering the high risk tolerance, I'm choosing to sell 20 shares of AAPL due to the potential impact of government shutdowns on the economy and markets. Although Apple's partnership with the Malala Fund is a positive factor, the overall market uncertainty outweighs the benefits. Selling some shares will allow me to take advantage of potential volatility and minimize potential losses."
2018-01-23,44.33,SELL,10,1100.0,1100,"Given Apple's recent delay in HomePod sales and ongoing lawsuits over dual-lens camera technology, I believe the stock price may experience a short-term downturn.

Considering my high risk tolerance, I decide to sell 10 shares to adjust my portfolio and take advantage of potential short-term opportunities."
2018-01-24,44.31,BUY - Insufficient funds,1000,1100.0,1100,"Given Qualcomm's â‚¬997 million fine by the European Union, it is likely that Apple's iPhone sales and revenue will increase due to increased competition. This could lead to an upward pressure on AAPL's stock price. With a high risk tolerance, I'm willing to take advantage of this potential opportunity."
2018-01-25,43.63,BUY - Insufficient funds,1000,1100.0,1100,"Despite Apple's earnings miss, the recent news about Qualcomm and Texas Instruments' chip stocks surge may indicate a positive trend in the tech sector.

2018-01-29,42.54,BUY - Insufficient funds,1000,1100.0,1100,"Although Apple's stock dipped slightly due to a report that it would halve iPhone X production, the news of Immersion Corp.'s settlement with Apple for touch feedback technology and better-than-expected sales from supplier AMS suggests a potential positive impact on AAPL. Additionally, tech stocks rallied on Monday, which could indicate a bullish trend for tech-heavy stocks like AAPL. Considering my high risk tolerance and the current market conditions, I believe buying more shares of AAPL will be a strategic move to capitalize on these potential positive factors."
