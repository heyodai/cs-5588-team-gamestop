## Project Description

In today's digital age, where information is abundant and easily accessible, financial markets have grown increasingly interconnected and complex. Traditional financial analysis methods often struggle to fully capture this intricate market behavior, highlighting the need for a more advanced, multidimensional approach. 

Leveraging modern technology to extract actionable insights from the vast array of financial data has become essential. Predicting the stock market has important applications for managing investments as well as larger scale sociopolitical implications. Analyzing historical data and incorporating social media and financial news can help provide important information in prediction.
