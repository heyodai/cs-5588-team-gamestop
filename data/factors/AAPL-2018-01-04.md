Security researchers have disclosed a set of security flaws that could let hackers steal sensitive information from nearly every modern computing device containing chips from Intel Corp, Advanced Micro Devices Inc, and ARM Holdings. One of the bugs is specific to Intel, while another affects laptops, desktop computers, smartphones, tablets, and internet servers alike. The flaws were discovered by researchers on Wednesday.

Here's what you need to do about these newly discovered computer chip flaws:

* "Meltdown" is a flaw that affects laptops, desktop computers, and internet servers with Intel chips and could let hackers steal data, such as passwords saved in Web browsers.
* Microsoft Corp, Apple Inc, and Linux are all issuing updates, though the Apple and Microsoft have not said precisely when.

To protect yourself from these flaws:

1. Check if your device is affected: Visit the websites of the major operating systems (Windows, macOS, and Linux) to see if they have released updates to address the vulnerabilities.
2. Apply the updates: Install the available patches as soon as possible.
3. Use strong passwords and two-factor authentication: This will make it harder for hackers to steal your data even if a vulnerability is exploited.
4. Consider using a virtual private network (VPN): A VPN can add an extra layer of security when using public Wi-Fi networks.

It's worth noting that the flaws are not unique to Intel, and other companies with ARM-based processors may also be affected. However, Intel has said that it is working on patches for its chips, while ARM Holdings has issued a statement saying that it is "monitoring the situation" and will provide guidance as more information becomes available.
