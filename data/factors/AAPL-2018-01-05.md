The article discusses two major chip flaws, Meltdown and Spectre, that have been disclosed by Alphabet Inc's Google and other security researchers. These flaws affect nearly all computer chips made in the last decade, including those used in Apple's iPhones, Macs, and iPads. As a result, hundreds of millions of iPhone and iPad users may be at risk if they use their devices without proper protection.

Apple has confirmed that its devices are affected by both Meltdown and Spectre, but it is working to release a patch for the Safari web browser on its iOS devices within days. This means that iPhone and iPad users will have some level of security protection until Apple issues its patch.

In addition to the chip flaws, the article also mentions other potential risks to device users, including:

* The fact that many popular browsers, including Safari, are not patched against these vulnerabilities.
* The risk that hackers may use these vulnerabilities to gain access to sensitive information on devices.
* The importance of taking steps to protect oneself from these vulnerabilities, such as updating software and using strong passwords.

Overall, the article highlights the potential risks posed by these chip flaws and encourages users to take steps to protect themselves until Apple releases a patch.
