It appears that there is no single piece of news or report that stands out as being particularly significant or timely. However, some of the articles do mention upcoming events and announcements from various companies.

Here are a few potential takeaways:

* Bank of America Corp. (BAC) will be reporting next week.
* Apple has signed a deal to stream an eight-episode series.
* The Dow 30 index endured a volatile week, with Boeing's Q4 deliveries up year-over-year and Merck's Keytruda combo showing success.
* Apple is expected to pay out $100 billion in dividends, but some speculate that this could be used for other purposes.

It's worth noting that none of these articles provide new or groundbreaking information about the companies mentioned. Rather, they appear to be providing general updates on existing news and trends.
