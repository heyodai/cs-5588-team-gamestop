**Qualcomm Gets $1.2 Billion EU Fine for Apple Chip Payments**

The European Union has fined Qualcomm Inc. $1.2 billion for paying Apple Inc. to shun rival chips in its iPhones.

*   The fine, which is approximately â‚¬997 million ($1.23 billion), was imposed by the European Commission for Qualcomm's anti-competitive behavior.
*   The commission accused Qualcomm of illegally shutting out rivals from the market for LTE baseband chipsets for over five years, thereby cementing its market dominance.
*   The fine is a significant blow to Qualcomm, which has been engaged in a wide-ranging legal battle with Apple over patent royalty rebates.

**Background on the Case**

The case began in 2015, when the European Commission launched an investigation into Qualcomm's business practices. The commission accused Qualcomm of engaging in anti-competitive behavior by paying exclusivity fees to Apple to ensure that the iPhone maker only used its chips.
*   The payments allegedly prevented other chipmakers from competing with Qualcomm for contracts with major phone manufacturers.
*   The case has been ongoing for several years, with both parties exchanging claims and counterclaims.

**Reaction from Qualcomm**

Qualcomm has announced that it will appeal the fine.  The company expects no impact on its ongoing operations.

"Today's ruling is a setback for our efforts to innovate and compete in the global marketplace," said a spokesperson for Qualcomm. "We have consistently defended ourselves against these claims, and we will continue to do so."

**Implications of the Fine**

The fine has significant implications for both Qualcomm and Apple.

*   For Qualcomm, the fine could be a major blow to its reputation and profitability.
*   For Apple, the fine is just one aspect of a larger legal battle with Qualcomm.
