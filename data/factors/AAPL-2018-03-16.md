This article appears to be a collection of news and analysis pieces from various sources. There is no single product or topic that ties the entire article together. However, I can provide some general insights based on the content.

The article discusses several topics related to technology and business, including:

1. Fitbit: The company's struggles in the smartwatch market.
2. Google and Facebook: Potential threats from "winter storms" (unspecified events or trends).
3. Fortnite: A popular mobile game that has gained popularity among players.
4. Dow 30 stock updates: News on various stocks, including Boeing, Merck, and Apple.
5. Blockchain and Apple: A potential patent filing related to blockchain technology.
6. Samsung: The company's challenges in the smartphone market, particularly with its latest flagship models.

If you're interested in purchasing a new smartphone, it appears that Fitbit is not a viable option due to its struggles in the market. However, there is no direct mention of any other smartphone brands or products in the article.

To answer your question directly, I would say that there is no explicit message from the article urging readers to buy Samsung's new smartphone (although Samsung does get mentioned as having challenges).
