This appears to be a collection of news articles about Apple, but none of them are directly related to a media event scheduled for March 27. The article about education suggests that Apple may be announcing new products or initiatives in the educational technology space.

Some other potential topics that could be covered by this event include:

* New iPhone or iPad models
* Updates to Apple's services, such as Apple Music or iCloud
* Announcements about Apple's plans for artificial intelligence and machine learning
* Updates on Apple's efforts to expand its presence in new markets, such as China

However, without more information, it is difficult to say for certain what will be announced at the event.
