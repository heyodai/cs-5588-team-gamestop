Here are three stocks suitable for novice swing traders:

1. **Alphabet (GOOGL)**: As the parent company of Google, Alphabet is a large-cap stock with predictable patterns. It's a good starting point for novice swing traders due to its stability and relatively low volatility.

2. **Microsoft (MSFT)**: Microsoft has been a consistent performer in the tech sector, making it an attractive option for swing traders. Its dividend yield is also relatively high, which can be beneficial for those looking to generate passive income.

3. **Nike (NKE)**: Nike is a well-established brand with a strong track record of success. Its stock price has historically been influenced by its earnings reports and sales performance, making it a good choice for swing traders who want to capitalize on predictable patterns.

These stocks are considered suitable for novice swing traders because they:

* Are large-cap stocks, which tend to be less volatile than smaller companies
* Have relatively predictable patterns, making it easier to identify trends and make informed trading decisions
* Offer opportunities for generating passive income through dividend payments (in the case of Microsoft)
* Have a strong brand reputation, which can help drive sales and revenue growth
