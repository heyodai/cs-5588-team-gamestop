Based on the provided article snippets, it appears that Apple Inc. (AAPL) is planning to move away from Intel Corporation (INTC) based processors in its Mac products and switch to Apple-designed ones. This could potentially hurt Intel's personal computer chip sales.

Some potential winners if Apple ditches Intel include:

* Apple itself, as it would gain more control over its own processor designs
* Other companies that currently supply Apple with custom processors, such as Samsung or TSMC

However, there are also potential losers, including:

* Intel Corporation (INTC), which would see a decline in sales from its personal computer chip business
* Android manufacturers, which may face increased competition from Apple's new Mac lineup
