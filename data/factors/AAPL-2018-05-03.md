It appears that this is a collection of news articles and stock market information, rather than a coherent article or guide. However, I can try to summarize some of the main points:

* Value investors should look for stocks that pay dividends, as these are often undervalued and offer a steady source of income.
* Apple Inc. (AAPL) recently reported strong earnings results, which may have lifted the stock price.
* The Federal Reserve has announced that it will not raise interest rates this month, which could be good news for investors who are sensitive to changes in monetary policy.
* Xiaomi Corp., a Chinese smartphone maker, is planning to go public with an IPO worth up to $100 billion, making it one of the largest tech IPOs in recent years.
* The stock market is still waiting for clarity on the trade war between the US and China, which has been causing volatility in the markets.

Some specific stocks mentioned in the articles include:

* Apple Inc. (AAPL)
* Xiaomi Corp. (not a public company at the time of writing, but planning to go public soon)
* Fitbit Inc. (NYSE: FIT)

If you're looking for investment advice or guidance on how to approach value investing with dividend-paying stocks, I'd be happy to try and provide more general information or point you in the direction of some reputable resources.
