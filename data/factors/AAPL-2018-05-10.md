Apple has cancelled its plans to build an 850 million euro ($1 billion) data center in Ireland due to delays in the approval process. The project was approved by Ireland's High Court in October, but Apple decided to scrap it after more than three years of delays. This decision is likely a result of Apple's frustration with the planning appeals and the time it took to secure approval for the project.
