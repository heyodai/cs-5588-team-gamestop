Microsoft is planning to release a line of lower-cost Surface tablets, which would compete with Apple's iPad. This move aims to tap into the market for cheaper devices that are currently dominated by Apple's iPad.

Key points:

*   Microsoft has been trying to enter this market before and had limited success.
*   The company has shifted its focus towards more expensive products like the Surface Pro, which has gained traction in the market.
*   The new lower-cost tablets would likely be positioned as a more affordable alternative to Apple's iPad.

This move could potentially give Microsoft a boost in the tablet market, especially if the devices are priced competitively and offer features that appeal to consumers. However, it's worth noting that this is not an easy market to break into, given Apple's strong brand presence and loyal customer base.
