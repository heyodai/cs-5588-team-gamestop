Here's a summary of the current events in the world of tech:

* Micron Technology (MU) is rallying after confirming that it was notified of a temporary injunction banning some sales of its parts in China, but expects the ban to not hurt its Q4 results due to limited impact on its sales.
* Apple may launch the new iPhone with a wider range of colors, according to a report from analyst Ming-Chi Kuo. This would be a significant change for the company's product lineup, which has traditionally offered only a limited number of color options.
* Qorvo Inc. (QRVO) shares are rising after KeyBanc Capital Markets upgraded the stock to overweight and predicted that the company will benefit from improving phone demand in China.
* The tech industry is expected to rally as investors await news on U.S.-China trade tensions, which could impact global manufacturers and chip stocks.
* Qorvo's upgrade was driven by its strong position in the China handset market and Apple's planned release of new iPhones.
