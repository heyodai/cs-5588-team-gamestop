The article reports that Apple Watch, Fitbit, and Sonos connected speakers may see price hikes due to US tariffs. The devices have been classified as "data transmission machines" under a US tariff code, which means they will be subject to import duties. This could lead to higher prices for consumers in the United States.

Here are some key points from the article:

* Apple Watch, Fitbit activity trackers, and Sonos connected speakers may see price hikes due to US tariffs.
* The devices have been classified as "data transmission machines" under a US tariff code.
* Consumer technology products such as mobile phones and laptops have so far faced little danger of import duties.
* However, the ruling shows that gadget makers are unlikely to be spared altogether and may have to consider price hikes on products that millions of consumers use every day.
* The devices will be subject to 25% tariffs on July 1st, unless the US and China reach a trade deal.

Overall, the article suggests that the impact of US tariffs on consumer electronics could be significant, particularly for companies like Apple, Fitbit, and Sonos.
