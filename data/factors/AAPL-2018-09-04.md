It appears that this is not a coherent article or passage, but rather a collection of news snippets and market-related information. However, I can extract some key points related to Apple's potential next big product:

* Former Apple software engineer Ken Kocienda believes that Apple's next big product will likely surround augmented reality (AR) technology.
* Canaccord Genuity analyst Michael Walkley has upgraded his price target on Apple to $250 from $220, citing "resilient iPhone sales".
* Apple is expected to launch three new iPhones in September, which could help the company continue growing its global share of the premium smartphone market.

Overall, it seems that AR technology is becoming a major focus for Apple and other tech companies, with potential implications for the future of consumer electronics.
