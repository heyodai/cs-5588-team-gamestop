The article discusses various financial and tech-related topics, but it does not mention anything about smart beta ETFs. However, I can provide information on what smart beta ETFs are and their purpose.

Smart beta ETFs are exchange-traded funds that use alternative strategies to traditional market capitalization weighting methods for selecting securities. The term "smart" refers to the fact that these funds aim to outperform traditional market-based indexes by using advanced statistical models, factor-based approaches, or other sophisticated techniques to construct their portfolios.

The primary purpose of smart beta ETFs is to provide investors with a way to gain exposure to specific factors that are believed to drive stock performance, such as value, momentum, size, quality, and others. By using these alternative weighting methods, smart beta ETFs aim to capture specific risks or opportunities in the market that may not be fully represented by traditional market capitalization-weighted indexes.

In the context of the Fidelity High Dividend ETF (FDVV), which was mentioned at the beginning of the article, it is a smart beta ETF that focuses on dividend-paying stocks. It uses a proprietary methodology to select securities and aims to provide investors with exposure to high-dividend stocks that are expected to outperform the broader market.

Overall, smart beta ETFs offer investors a range of alternative investment options that can help them achieve their investment goals in different ways.
