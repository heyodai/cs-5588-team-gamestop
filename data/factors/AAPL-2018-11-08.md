Based on the provided text, it appears that Apple's supplier AAC Technologies Holdings Inc reported a 28.7% drop in quarterly net profit due to lackluster iPhone sales. This information is not directly related to individual investors or market volatility, but rather provides context for the tech industry.

To answer the original question, "Individual investors were jolted by the sudden reappearance of market volatility in October... Given a range of issues spanning natural gas availability heading into winter oil sanctions on Iran and an escalating trade war with China, it's possible that increased volatility is here to stay," there is no direct information provided about individual investors or market trends.

However, based on the overall context of the article, which discusses various market-related topics such as Apple's supplier AAC Technologies Holdings Inc, Netflix's stock surge, and falling NAND flash prices, it can be inferred that individual investors may want to consider diversifying their portfolios or being more cautious due to the potential for increased market volatility.
