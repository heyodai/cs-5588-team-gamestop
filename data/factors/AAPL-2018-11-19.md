3. **Tech Industry Regulation**: Cook also mentions that tech industry regulation "is inevitable" and that politicians will step in to address concerns about the industry.
4. **Chipmaker Warnings**: Chip buyers have issued warnings about weaker demand, but some are preferring to order cautiously due to macro uncertainty and confidence that they can up their orders without worrying about supply shortages.
5. **Apple's Earnings Concerns**: Apple's earnings forecast has been a concern for investors, with the company cutting its production plan for iPhone XR by up to a third.
6. **Taiwan's Earnings Outlook**: Taiwan companies are bracing for disappointing earnings due to waning demand for iPhones and deteriorating relations between Taiwan and its two biggest trade partners.
