This article discusses the recent decline in technology stocks across Asia and the United States, largely due to concerns over slowing iPhone demand, the US-China trade war, and fears about tech industry regulation. Here are the main points:

1. **US-China tensions**: Investors blamed tensions between the US and China for the sell-off, particularly after a fractious APEC summit over the weekend.
2. **Apple's iPhone sales**: Lower-than-expected demand for Apple's new iPhones led to a sharp decline in stock prices, with some analysts expecting weaker sales due to increased competition.
3. **FAANG stocks**: The five biggest US tech companies (Facebook, Amazon, Apple, Netflix, and Alphabet) saw their shares fall in bear market territory on Monday, with Facebook, Amazon, and Apple leading the way.
4. **Nissan's Ghosn arrest**: The arrest of Nissan Chairman Carlos Ghosn sent shockwaves through the Japanese stock market, with his company's shares plummeting 5.5% to a three-week low.
5. **Tech supply chain uncertainty**: The decline in iPhone sales has created turmoil along Apple's supply chain, making it harder for the company to predict demand and order components.

Overall, the article suggests that investors are increasingly concerned about the impact of the US-China trade war on the tech industry, as well as fears about regulation and slowing growth.
