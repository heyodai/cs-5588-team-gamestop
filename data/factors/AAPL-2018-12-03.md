Here are the five things you must know:

1. **US-China Trade War Truce**: US President Donald Trump has announced a 90-day "truce" in the trade war with China, delaying the implementation of tariffs on $200 billion worth of Chinese goods until at least January 1.
2. **Apple's 5G iPhone Delay**: Apple will wait until at least 2020 to release a 5G-enabled iPhone, due to concerns about the stability and reliability of the new network technology.
3. **Global Stock Market Rally**: The US stock market has surged after Trump's announcement, with the S&P 500 rising 1.4% and the Nasdaq Composite up 1.9%. European markets have also seen significant gains.
4. **Microsoft's Rise to World's Most Valuable Company**: Microsoft has reclaimed its position as the world's most valuable company, surpassing Apple's market capitalization of $851 billion. This is due in part to its focus on selling fast-growing computing services to companies.
5. **Spotify's Underwhelming Performance**: Despite making its market debut with a promising price, Spotify's stock has only risen 3% in 2018, underperforming expectations. The company's fundamental performance and growth prospects may be a contributing factor to this lackluster performance.
