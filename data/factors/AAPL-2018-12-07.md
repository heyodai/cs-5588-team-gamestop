According to the article, Warren Buffett was frustrated with the lack of attractive investment opportunities due to the state of the economy. Despite having a large cash hoard, he found it difficult to put the money to work effectively. The article mentions that Buffett has been looking for ways to invest in 2018, but hasn't yet found the right opportunities.

Additionally, the article touches on other market-related news, such as:
