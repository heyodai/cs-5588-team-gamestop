The article highlights the challenges facing Apple, particularly in Taiwan, where many components are manufactured for the iPhone. Despite concerns about slowing iPhone sales and the impact of US tariffs on Chinese-made devices, Taiwanese suppliers have reported a 9.3% increase in November sales compared to last year. This suggests that demand for Apple's products is still strong in the region.

The article also mentions that Foxconn Technology Group, which is the flagship company of Hon Hai Precision Industry Co., saw combined October and November sales grow by 12.9%. Pegatron Corp., another major supplier, reported a 25% increase in sales during the same period.

These positive sales figures suggest that Apple may not need to drastically change its pricing strategy for the iPhone XS and XR models. Instead, it might stick with its traditional formula for selling "cheaper" high-end phones.

Furthermore, the article mentions that Apple has been hit with a sales ban on older iPhone models in China due to alleged patent infringement by Qualcomm. This development highlights the challenges facing Apple's business in China, particularly during a time of strained relations between the US and China.

Overall, the article presents a nuanced view of Apple's situation in Taiwan and China, highlighting both positive trends and challenges that the company faces.
