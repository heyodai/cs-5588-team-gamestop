China's copper imports have fallen for two consecutive months, indicating a slowdown in the country's economic activity. This trend has led some analysts to question whether China still needs a new economic model. Here are some key points from the article:

1. **Copper imports fell**: In December, China imported 429,000 metric tons of unwrought copper, a 4.7% decline year-over-year and lower on a sequential basis.
2. **Fiscal 2018 picture was strong**: Unwrought copper and copper ore imports rose in fiscal 2018, suggesting that the underlying demand from China has been strong.
3. **Slowdown in Chinese copper imports**: However, the recent trend of falling copper imports suggests that China's economic slowdown may be more pronounced than previously thought.
4. **Copper miners' expectations**: Leading copper miners, including Freeport-McMoRan (FCX), have maintained that underlying demand from China has been strong, but falling Chinese copper imports might persuade them to tone down their expectations for China's copper demand.
5. **Impact on Apple and other companies**: The slowdown in China's economic activity is also affecting companies like Apple, which lowered its revenue forecast due to the decline in sales.

Overall, the fall in Chinese copper imports suggests that China's economy may be experiencing a deeper slowdown than initially thought, with implications for the global economy and companies that rely on China's growth.
