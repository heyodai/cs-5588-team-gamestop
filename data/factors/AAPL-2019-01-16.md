According to the text, Verizon will offer free Apple Music to some U.S. customers starting January 17, as part of their "Beyond Unlimited" and "Above Unlimited" plans. This is a result of a partnership between Verizon and Apple announced last year, which included six months of Apple Music streaming service for some customers with their data plan.
