Based on the text provided, Aurora Cannabis seems to be a larger and more globally-reach marijuana company compared to Apple. It claims to have the largest production capacity in the cannabis industry, and its global reach is greater than that of most of its competitors.

However, it's not clear if this advantage alone makes Aurora a smarter pick for investors right now. The text mentions that stocks are often bought because of a company's reputation rather than its investment potential, and that investors frequently pay a high price for making errors in their stock picks.

The main point of the article is to highlight why Apple may be stronger than it looks, despite its recent decline in revenue and profits. CEO Tim Cook pointed to China's economic slowdown and Washington's trade war as the causes of lower iPhone sales, but also beat expectations with his outlook.

It seems that the article is trying to make a case for Apple being stronger than it appears on the surface, while also mentioning Aurora Cannabis as a larger and more globally-reach company in the marijuana industry.
