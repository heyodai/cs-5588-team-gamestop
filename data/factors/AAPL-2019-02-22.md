According to the article, Apple has teamed up with Ant Financial Services Group and several local banks in China to offer interest-free financing for iPhones. The scheme allows customers to pay 271 yuan ($40.31) per month to purchase an iPhone XR, and 362 yuan per month for an iPhone XS, over a period of up to two years. This is Apple's first such move in the country as it looks to boost waning smartphone sales.
