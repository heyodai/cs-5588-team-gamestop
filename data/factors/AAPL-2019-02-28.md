It appears that there are several news articles and reports mentioned in this text, but they don't form a coherent narrative. However, I can summarize some of the main points:

* US President Donald Trump said he walked away from a nuclear deal with North Korea due to unacceptable demands from Kim Jong Un.
* There is speculation about a possible trade deal between the US and China, which could lead to a rebound in the stock market. Three stocks that are well-positioned for a rally include Brunswick Corp., Harley-Davidson, and Polaris Industries.
* Apple has laid off 190 employees from its self-driving car unit, Project Titan.
* Microsoft is considered as a potential candidate to become a $1 trillion company this year.

If you'd like me to summarize or analyze any of these points further, please let me know!
