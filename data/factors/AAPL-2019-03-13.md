Spotify has filed an EU antitrust complaint against Apple, alleging that Apple unfairly limits rivals to its own Apple Music streaming service. The complaint centers around a 30% fee Apple charges content-based service providers to use its in-app purchase system (IAP). Spotify claims this restricts music-streaming services from competing with Apple Music and deprives consumers of choice.
