There are several news articles about Foxconn's chairman, Terry Gou, who plans to step down from daily operations in the coming months. Here are some key points:

* Foxconn chairman Terry Gou plans to withdraw from daily operations after having developed and mentored a new generation of talent to carry on Foxconn's mission.
* A change in leadership would come at a delicate time for the company, which is trying to reinvent itself to cut its reliance on Apple as smartphone sales plateau and as the iPhone maker diversifies its supplier base.

Gou had previously announced that he planned to step down in the coming months to pave the way for younger talent to move up the company's ranks. However, his statement on Tuesday seemed to suggest that he would continue to provide strategic direction and guidance as chairman, rather than stepping down completely.
