Based on the article, here are some key points about Vale stock:

1. **Volatile performance**: Vale stock has been volatile since the Brumadinho dam break in January, with shares gapping down to uptrend support and then flushing below it.
2. **Rebound attempts**: The stock rebounded to trendline support but failed on its retest, which led to a bounce off this mark.
3. **Potential for growth**: With recent higher lows and a potential run to $14.50, Vale could gain momentum and clear major moving averages.
4. **Downtrend risk**: Below uptrend support, the stock will likely test its 50-day moving average, which could lead to a drop if it doesn't hold.
5. **Dam disaster aftermath**: The Brumadinho dam break is still an overhang for Vale stock, with potential costs and volatility due to management's lack of details on the situation.

Overall, while Vale stock has shown some resilience since the dam break, its performance remains volatile, and investors should be cautious about any potential setbacks.
