The article reports that Japan Display, an Apple supplier, has warned that it cannot guarantee a return to profit this year due to weak demand for smartphone screens. The company has also announced plans to slash around 1,000 jobs, or about a fifth of its workforce, as part of a proposed bailout deal with a Chinese-Taiwanese group.

Key points:

* Japan Display reported a net loss of 98.6 billion yen (around $900 million) for the three months ended March, its ninth consecutive quarterly loss.
* The company has seen weak demand for smartphone screens, which have shifted to organic light-emitting diode (OLED) screens.
* Apple's iPhone XR, with a liquid crystal display (LCD) screen, is the only model that still uses LCD screens, contributing to Japan Display's struggles.
* The company plans to slash around 1,000 jobs as part of its proposed bailout deal.

Implications:

* The weak demand for smartphone screens and poor sales of the iPhone XR are likely to continue affecting Japan Display's financial performance.
* The planned job cuts may impact the company's ability to recover from its losses.
* The proposed bailout deal with a Chinese-Taiwanese group may provide some stability, but the terms of the deal have not been disclosed.

Stock market reactions:

* Apple's stock has fallen over 10% in May due to concerns about the US-China trade war and potential antitrust cases against the company.
* Japan Display's stock price has likely taken a hit due to its weak financial performance and planned job cuts.
