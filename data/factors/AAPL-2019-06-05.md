This appears to be an article from The Wall Street Journal, summarizing recent news and trends in technology, business, and finance. Here's a brief summary:

* Trade conflicts: US Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross said the US will not back down on its demands for China to change its trade practices.
* Apple and Google: The Justice Department is considering a joint investigation of Apple and Alphabet Inc.'s (Google) antitrust complaints.
* EU-US trade deal: The European Union's chief negotiator said that the EU would only accept a trade agreement with the US if it includes significant changes to the EU's digital single market rules.
* Tech regulation: Global regulators are tightening their grip on big tech, including investigations into Google's ad business and Amazon's market dominance.
* Stock market: The Dow Jones Industrial Average was up in pre-market trading, driven by optimism over a potential interest rate cut.

Some key quotes from the article include:

* "We do not know how or when these issues will be resolved" - US Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross
* "The government hasn’t said why it’s grouping Apple and Google under Justice, or how it might apply antitrust law to their businesses." - A person familiar with the matter

Note that the article is quite dense and includes many references to specific companies and industries (e.g. Campbell Soup, Cronos, Fitbit). If you're looking for a summary of these topics, I can try to provide more general information on each area.
