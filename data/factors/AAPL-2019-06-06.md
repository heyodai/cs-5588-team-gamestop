Based on the text, it appears that there are several news articles and statements related to Apple's latest move. Here is a summary:

* Apple has introduced "Sign In With Apple", a single sign-on system for iOS apps.
* The move requires any developer integrating a third-party SSO system into an app to add Apple's SSO service as an option.
* This move could potentially hurt Facebook and Google, as they may lose access to user data.
* The news has caused stocks to fluctuate, with Apple's stock outperforming the market.

It is unclear what specific actions will be taken against Facebook and Google, but it appears that the companies are being scrutinized by U.S. antitrust enforcers, who have divided oversight over them.
