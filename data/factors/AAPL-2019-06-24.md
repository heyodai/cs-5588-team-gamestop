The article discusses how Western retailers are rethinking their strategies in China due to the country's slowing economy and changing consumer behavior. Carrefour SA, Europe's largest retailer, has sold 80% of its Chinese business for $699 million in cash to Suning.com, a Chinese retailer backed by Alibaba Group Holding Ltd., in order to reduce losses.

The article highlights several challenges that Western retailers face in China, including:

1. Slowing sales: Carrefour's share of the country's hypermarket segment fell from 8.2% in 2009 to 4.6% last year.
2. Increased competition from online players: Online-only players such as Alibaba have been putting pressure on brick-and-mortar operations, with Tesco Plc, Best Buy Co., and Marks & Spencer Plc each announcing plans to pull back from the mainland market.
3. Changing consumer behavior: Chinese consumers are increasingly preferring domestic brands in categories like food and drinks and home appliances.

To address these challenges, Western retailers may consider ceding control to local partners or partnering with Chinese companies to better understand the local market. The article mentions several examples of this strategy, including McDonald's Corp.'s sale of 80% of its China business in 2017 to a tie-up between state giant Citic Group Corp. and private equity firm Carlyle Group LP, and Walmart Inc.'s sale of its e-commerce delivery site to JD.com Inc. in 2016.

The article concludes that Carrefour's decision to sell its Chinese business is likely not the last such move by Western retailers, as other companies like Metro AG are also looking to exit their China operations.
