The article discusses Monzo, a UK-based fintech startup that aims to displace traditional lenders with its mobile app and crowdfunding events. However, the author expresses skepticism about Monzo's ability to succeed in the low-margin market dominated by big banks. Here are some key points:

1. **Monzo's business model**: Unlike traditional banks, Monzo relies on fees and commissions rather than lending from customer deposits.
2. **Regulatory pressure**: Banking license requirements and regulatory changes have pushed Monzo to raise extra funds in 2017, and new rules are coming in all the time.
3. **Compliance demands**: Big financial firms like JPMorgan Chase & Co. have an advantage over startups due to their institutional simplicity and ability to spend more on technology.
4. **Scaling issues**: As Monzo expands to the US market, it will face stiff competition from established banks and tech giants, which may use their resources to disrupt the market.

The author concludes that Monzo's success is uncertain, and its business model may not be sustainable in the long term. The article also mentions Apple's acquisition of autonomous-driving startup Drive.ai, which could signal a renewed push into driverless cars by the tech giant.
