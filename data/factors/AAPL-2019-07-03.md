The article discusses Samsung's delay in launching its Galaxy Fold, a foldable smartphone that was expected to be released in August. The company has been working on the device for eight years and spent billions of dollars on research and development. However, the phone has encountered several issues, including a plastic layer covering the screen that failed to function properly after being removed, and a small tear developed at the top of the hinge where the gadget opened.

Despite these challenges, Samsung is still committed to releasing the Galaxy Fold and has already begun shipping major components such as the display and battery to a plant in Vietnam for assembly. However, the company is unlikely to unveil the device during an upcoming "Unpack" event in New York for its new flagship Note 10 phone.

The delay has been attributed to the challenges of creating a display that folds like a notebook, which Samsung spent eight years trying to master. Analysts say it's unclear whether companies can develop apps to take full advantage of the innovative screen.

Samsung is not alone in facing challenges with foldable devices. Huawei postponed the roll-out of its own foldable device, the Mate X, and other companies are also struggling to make foldable smartphones work. Despite these challenges, Samsung remains committed to the technology and has already developed several prototypes, including a clamshell-like foldable phone.

The article highlights the risks and rewards of investing in new technologies like foldable displays. While there is potential for significant growth and innovation, there are also challenges and uncertainties that must be addressed before the technology can become mainstream.
