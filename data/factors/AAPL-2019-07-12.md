The article discusses how US tech companies are facing challenges due to the escalating trade tensions between the US and China. Despite this, some companies are making efforts to maintain their presence in China and navigate the complex geopolitical landscape.

Some points made in the article include:

*   Apple is shifting production of its new Mac Pro computer to China, signaling support for the country despite US President Donald Trump's threat of tariffs.
*   Walmart Inc. has pledged $1.2 billion to invest in China's logistics distribution centers, demonstrating a commitment to the market.
*   Boeing Co. is in negotiations to sell 100 jetliners to Chinese airlines, one of its largest-ever deals.
*   IBM has a long history with China, dating back to the 1920s, and sees the country as an "indispensable part" of its global strategy map.

The article also highlights the challenges faced by US tech companies in dealing with China. The Trump administration is concerned that American companies could help China's tech industry eclipse U.S. prowess in sensitive areas like artificial intelligence and machine learning.

In response, some companies are seeking to diversify their supply chains and reduce their reliance on Chinese components. However, this may not be enough to shield them from the impact of tariffs and trade restrictions.

The article concludes that US tech companies must now live in a world where their Chinese business partners and global value chains could potentially "blow up" at any given day. As James Lewis, director of the tech and public policy program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, noted, "Trump might have backed off Huawei for now but next week it could be something different and any of these companies are fair game."
