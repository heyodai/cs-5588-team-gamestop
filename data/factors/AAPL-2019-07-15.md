The article discusses the work of economist Philippe Aghion, who argues that targeting wealth concentration among the top 1% is not necessarily a great evil. Instead, he believes that governments should focus on ensuring that new innovators are free to challenge and replace incumbent companies, which would promote innovation and social mobility.

Aghion's view is based on the idea that companies create "rents" through their innovations, and that governments should not excessively target these extra profits as it would stifle innovation. He also points out that there is no evidence that faster innovation would produce more inequality further down the income scale.

The article highlights Aghion's finding that the growth rate of total factor productivity rose sharply in the 1990s but declined since then, and that companies are becoming increasingly able to charge markups above their costs. This suggests that the barriers to entry erected by today's innovators have created a monopoly situation that stifles competition.

The article also notes that tax reforms, such as those introduced by French President Francois Hollande in 2012, may not be effective in reducing wealth concentration or promoting social mobility. Instead, it suggests that robust competition enforcement is a better answer to promote innovation and growth.

Overall, the article presents Aghion's argument that targeting wealth concentration among the top 1% is not necessarily a great evil, and that governments should focus on promoting innovation and competition instead.
