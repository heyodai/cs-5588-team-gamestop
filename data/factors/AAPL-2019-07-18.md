TSMC (Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company) shares have seen a significant increase in value this year, with a 12% gain despite the ongoing trade war. The company's second-half outlook is expected to improve, driven by its leading position in advanced technology, particularly in 5G and artificial intelligence. TSMC's strong performance has led to an increase in chip orders for crypto mining, which are expected to boost sales in the third quarter. The company also announced a dividend payout of NT$207 billion ($6.7 billion) on Thursday. Analysts at Bank of America Merrill Lynch predict that TSMC may re-rate its stock due to rising free cash flow and plan to pay out a minimum dividend per share of at least NT$10.

Key statistics for 3Q 2019 estimates:

* Gross margin: 48.3%
* Revenue: NT$276.6 billion (22 estimates)
* Net income (GAAP): NT$96.04 billion (20 estimates)
