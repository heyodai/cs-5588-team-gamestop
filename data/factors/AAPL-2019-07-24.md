The top 5 factors that may affect the stock price of AAPL (Apple) are not explicitly mentioned in the provided news articles. However, based on the content, here are some indirect implications and potential factors that could impact AAPL's stock price:

1. **Antitrust Probe**: The investigation into anticompetitive practices or monopoly power by the US government could lead to regulatory scrutiny, which might negatively affect AAPL's stock price if the company is found to have engaged in such practices.
2. **Data Migration Feature**: Apple's announcement of a new data migration feature for iPhones could generate interest among investors and users, potentially driving up the stock price if the feature is seen as innovative or beneficial.
3. **Market Sentiment Shifts**: The outflow from the iShares S&P 500 Value ETF (IVE) with approximately $125 million, which represents an 8% decrease in week-over-week shares outstanding, could signal a shift in market sentiment away from value stocks and towards growth stocks, potentially affecting AAPL's stock price.
4. **Technology Sector Slump**: The decline of the technology sector following antitrust scrutiny concerns might have a ripple effect on other tech companies, including AAPL, which could lead to a decrease in investor confidence and affect the stock price.
5. **Mature Microsoft Stock Value**: Although not directly related to AAPL, the comparison between mature Microsoft (MSFT) stock with a market value over $1 trillion and Apple's potential impact on the technology sector could imply that investors are reevaluating their investment strategies, potentially affecting AAPL's stock price.

Please note that these factors are indirect implications and might not have a direct impact on AAPL's stock price. Other news articles or events could provide more specific information about the factors that may affect AAPL's stock price.
