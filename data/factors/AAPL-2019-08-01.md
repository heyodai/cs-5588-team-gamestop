The article discusses Spotify's fiscal second quarter results, which missed analysts' expectations for subscriber growth. Despite this, Spotify reported revenue gains and a narrower loss. Here are some key points:

1. **Subscriber growth**: Spotify ended the quarter with 108 million subscribers to its premium service, which was slightly below the expected 108.5 million.
2. **Revenue growth**: Spotify's revenue grew by 26% year-over-year, exceeding analysts' expectations.
3. **Loss narrowing**: The company reported a loss of 42 cents per share, narrower than the previous year's loss of $2.20 per share.
4. **Competition concerns**: Investors have been worried about competition from Apple Music, Amazon Music, and YouTube, but Spotify said its subscribers grew at a rate twice that of Apple Music.
5. **User growth**: Spotify's overall user base grew to 232 million, exceeding Wall Street projections of 227 million.
6. **New royalty arrangements**: The company has reached agreements with two major record labels regarding licenses, which is seen as an important win for the company.

The article also mentions that investors have been expecting a higher subscriber growth rate and that the company's shares fell after the earnings report. However, the CEO of Spotify, Daniel Ek, said that the company plans to make up for the lost ground by year-end.

Overall, while Spotify's Q2 results missed some expectations, the company's revenue growth and user base expansion are positive signs. The competition from Apple Music and other music streaming services remains a concern, but Spotify's efforts to expand its user base outside of North America and Europe could help mitigate this risk.
