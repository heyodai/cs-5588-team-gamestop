The article discusses the potential for a change in administration after the 2020 presidential elections, specifically in relation to China's trade relations with the US. Here are some key points:

1. The US has threatened to impose tariffs on $300 billion worth of Chinese goods if China does not agree to certain economic reforms.
2. China has refused to commit to these reforms and has insisted that tariffs must be lifted before any changes are made.
3. The US Trade Representative's Office will release the final list of targeted products in the coming days, which is expected to include consumer and technology goods.
4. Analysts say the decision to walk away from the Osaka truce indicates a level of desperation by the Trump administration's efforts to force China to commit to economic reforms.
5. If the tariffs are imposed as threatened, China is likely to retaliate in some fashion, which could include imposing fines and restrictions on services vendors with a large presence in Greater China.

Overall, the article suggests that the US-China trade relationship remains tense and that a change in administration may be on the horizon.
