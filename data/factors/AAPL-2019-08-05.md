The article discusses Qualcomm Inc.'s (QCOM) stock performance, citing the company's recent court victory against China's tech ambitions as a positive factor. However, the author notes that the outcome is uncertain due to ongoing litigation and government rhetoric calling Qualcomm a "bulwark against China's tech ambitions."

Key points from the article:

1. **Qualcomm's court victory**: U.S. District Court Judge Lucy Koh ruled that Qualcomm's "no patent, no chips" practice is illegal.
2. **Administration fight**: The administration has asked for a stay of the decision and is continuing to pursue legal action against Qualcomm.
3. **China business**: Despite the rhetoric, Qualcomm continues to do business in China, with recent deals with Tencent Holdings and China to develop 5G technology for self-driving cars.
4. **Revenue estimates**: Qualcomm's GAAP earnings are $2.1 billion, or $1.75 per share, while its non-GAAP estimate is $0.65-0.75 per share.
5. **Dividend**: Qualcomm out-earns its dividend and has over $14 billion in cash and marketable securities.
6. **Market sentiment**: The uncertainty surrounding Qualcomm's business in China and the legal disputes makes QCOM stock range-bound, with some analysts viewing it as a bargain for income-oriented investors.

Investment recommendations:

* **Income-oriented investors**: Qualcomm could be an attractive option due to its consistent dividend payments and liquid assets.
* **Speculative investors**: Others may view Qualcomm as a speculative opportunity due to the uncertainty surrounding its business in China and the ongoing legal disputes.
