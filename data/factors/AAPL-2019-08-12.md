This article provides a summary of Apple's quarterly earnings report, as well as market trends and analyst reactions. Here are the main points:

**Apple's Q3 Earnings Report**

* Tim Cook reported that the quarter was the company's biggest June quarter ever, driven by record revenue from services, accelerating growth from wearables, and strong performance from iPad and Mac.
* The balance of calendar 2019 is expected to be an exciting period, with major launches on all platforms, new services, and several new products.

**US-China Trade Tensions**

* President Trump announced a 10% tariff on $300 billion in Chinese import goods starting September 1, which will impact Apple's supply chain and production costs.
* Analysts believe the tariffs will hold sales numbers down due to the longer smartphone lifecycle.

**Market Reaction**

* Markets declined in the first few days of August, responding to Trump's tweet and China's retaliatory move in devaluing the yuan.
* However, markets have recovered somewhat in recent sessions, with investors and China watchers holding back judgment on the tariffs.

**Analyst Reactions**

* Tom Forte from D. A. Davidson boosted his price target on AAPL from $245 to $270, suggesting an upside of 34%.
* Daniel Ives from Wedbush said the quarter was a major feather in the cap for bulls, driving the stock to new highs over the coming months.
* Wamsi Mohan from Merrill Lynch views the recent slip as a chance to pick up AAPL, with a buy recommendation and a $240 price target.

Overall, while Apple's quarterly earnings report had a positive tone, the ongoing US-China trade tensions and potential impact on the company's business may have caused some investors to sell off shares. However, analysts remain bullish on the stock, and market sentiment has recovered somewhat in recent days.
