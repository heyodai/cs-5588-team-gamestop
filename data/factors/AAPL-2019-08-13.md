Snap's decision to produce limited-edition Spectacles 3, despite not expecting significant revenue from them, suggests that the company is willing to test its augmented reality (AR) technology and hardware in the market, even if it doesn't make a profit. This move may be part of Snap's strategy to establish itself as a leader in AR technology and to gather feedback from users on how they would use such devices.

As you mentioned, other companies like Apple, Facebook, and Microsoft are also working on AR glasses and hardware, which could become a competitive market if AR technology becomes more popular. By entering this space now, Snap can establish itself as a player and potentially gain an advantage when the market is ready for consumer-friendly AR products.

It's worth noting that Snap's CEO, Evan Spiegel, is a strong believer in AR technology and its potential to change how we interact with digital information. He has expressed his vision for a future where computing is overlaid on the physical world, and Spectacles 3 could be an early step towards making that vision a reality.

While it's unclear whether Spectacles 3 will become a commercial success, Snap's decision to produce them suggests that the company is committed to exploring new technologies and formats, even if they don't immediately generate revenue.
