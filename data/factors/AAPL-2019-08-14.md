The article discusses how US companies are reconsidering their reliance on China as a manufacturing hub due to the ongoing trade tensions between the two countries. Taiwanese electronics companies, such as Inventec and Hon Hai Precision Industry Co., which assemble Apple Inc.'s AirPods and produce notebook computers for HP, are among those shifting production to other regions, including Southeast Asia and India.

The article highlights that rising tariffs on Chinese-made products threaten to wipe out margins and up-end a well-oiled supply chain. Microsoft Corp., Amazon.com Inc., Sony Corp., and Nintendo Co. are said to be among those considering their options away from the line of fire.

Analysts expect that the tariff delay announced by President Trump will have little impact on these plans, as many Taiwanese contract manufacturers had already begun shifting production or exploring alternative venues. Goldman Sachs analysts noted that while this announcement provides incremental information on how the White House is approaching trade policy, it does not represent a substantial shift in the US-China dispute.

The article also notes that the trade war threatens to disrupt a complex global supply chain involving many countries beyond just China and the US. However, few major manufacturers have moved output in truly significant amounts, and China's status as the world's production base for electronics is unlikely to diminish anytime soon.

Key points:

* Taiwanese electronics companies are shifting production away from China due to rising tariffs
