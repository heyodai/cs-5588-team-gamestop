SoftBank Group Corp.'s Masayoshi Son is facing a funding gap for his Vision Fund 2, according to a report by the Wall Street Journal. The company plans to lend its employees up to $20 billion to buy stakes in the venture-capital vehicle, with interest rates of around 5%. This move suggests desperation and a lack of external investment.

The Journal also notes that Son may account for $15 billion of the potential contribution from employees, and that SoftBank itself is putting in $38 billion. The report highlights the unusual practice of allowing employees to own stock in their employer, which can align corporate and employee incentives.

In contrast to the first Vision Fund, which had a lead investor, Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund, with a specific figure of $45 billion, the second fund appears to lack an external cornerstone investor. The announcement mentioned only Kazakhstan as a sovereign investor, and the investors are largely industry buddies and Japanese banks.

The report suggests that SoftBank will have to cast a wider net and use FOMO (fear of missing out) to convince investors to pull out the checkbook. However, it is unlikely that investors will be as enthusiastic about this latest venture as they were for the first Vision Fund.

The situation highlights the challenges facing SoftBank in raising funds for its Vision Fund 2, which has a target size of $108 billion. The company's ability to secure external investment and overcome funding gaps will be crucial to its success in meeting its goals.
