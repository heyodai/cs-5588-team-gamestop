The article discusses the Japanese companies JSR and TOK, which are two of the leading manufacturers of photo-resist materials used in the production of semiconductors. The companies have maintained their dominance in the market due to their expertise and reputation, but face challenges from Korean rivals such as Samsung.

JSR, a Tokyo-based company, has been at the forefront of the industry for decades, with a network of American industry contacts that helped it secure a partnership with IBM in 2000. This deal marked a turning point for the company, allowing it to shift its focus to higher-energy band lithography and increase its production capacity.

Today, JSR commands about 40% of the market for the latest generation of resist used in mass production, while TOK also supplies more than 30% of the photo-resist for 3D NAND flash memory chips. The companies' success is attributed to their ability to build strong relationships with customers and invest heavily in research and development.

However, the market for these materials is small and does not promise rapid growth. According to research firm Fuji Keizai Group, the industry's sales rose just shy of 8% last year to $1.3 billion. The article suggests that rebuilding JSR and TOK's reputation and infrastructure would be a costly endeavor, potentially worth less than the investment needed to regain their dominance.

The trade tensions between Japan and South Korea have also led to a situation where Korean corporations now depend on Japan for over 90% of all the fluorinated polyimide and resists they need. This has created an unusual dynamic, where Japan's actions may inadvertently encourage competition from its neighbor.

In conclusion, JSR and TOK are two Japanese companies that have maintained their dominance in the market for photo-resist materials through a combination of expertise, reputation, and strategic relationships. However, the market is small and fragmented, and they face challenges from Korean rivals. The trade tensions between Japan and South Korea have also created an unusual dynamic, where Japan's actions may inadvertently encourage competition from its neighbor.
