The article discusses the impact of the US-China trade war on Apple Inc.'s stock price and its reliance on China for iPhone production. The article states that:

* Apple's market value dropped by $44 billion after a pair of pronouncements from Beijing and Washington cast a spotlight on its massive Chinese production base.
* US President Donald Trump has ordered American companies to immediately look for alternatives to manufacturing in China, which is unprepared for such a move according to analyst David Ives.
* The company would require 5-7% of iPhone production out of China over the course of 18 months and 20% within three years, making it challenging to deploy Foxconn's claim of being able to build all US-bound iPhones outside of China.
* Apple has asked suppliers for proposals on ex-China production but has rejected some options and expanded in China instead.
* The company is currently lobbying Washington for tariff relief and will need to draw up comprehensive plans for building iPhones outside of China if the trade war persists.

* The stock market rally and Fed rate cuts are no match for President Trump's escalating China trade war, as reflected in volatile Dow Jones futures.
* Apple has so far been able to obtain a temporary reprieve for iPhones, iPads, and Apple laptops from US tariffs until December 15.
* The company is heavily reliant on China for iPhone production, which makes it vulnerable to changes in the trade relationship.
