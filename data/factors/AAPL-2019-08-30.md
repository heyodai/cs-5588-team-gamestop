The article discusses the lives of women working at Foxconn, a Chinese factory that produces iPhones among other products. The article highlights the challenges they face in making ends meet, despite earning a decent wage. 

Specifically, Jayadas Kallivettu, one of the workers interviewed, earns around $130 per month and has to balance her household expenses with saving up for her future goals. She dreams of opening a beauty salon but struggles to make ends meet.

The article also mentions that 400 women failed to show up for their daily shift because they were taking the government's teacher recruitment exam, which pays a third of what they earn at Foxconn.

These women are not just workers; they are also individuals with goals and aspirations. They deserve better working conditions, fair wages, and respect in the workplace.
