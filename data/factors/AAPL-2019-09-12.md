Taiwan's Foxconn founder Terry Gou has withdrawn from the opposition Kuomintang party, a necessary step to run as an independent candidate in the upcoming presidential election. This move could shake up Taiwan's political landscape and complicate the KMT's bid to oust President Tsai Ing-wen and her Democratic Progressive Party. Gou, who supports closer ties with China, has been gaining momentum for his potential candidacy despite losing the KMT primary to Han Kuo-yu in July.
