This is not a stock analysis or recommendation article. It appears to be a collection of news articles and updates from various financial news sources, including InvestorPlace, Financial Times, and others. 

However, if you'd like me to summarize the main points of these articles in a neutral tone, I can do that for you:

* Qualcomm's 5G chipset market growth is expected to reach $23 billion by 2026, with a compound annual growth rate of 61%.
* Corning announced a downgrade of its third-quarter guidance for display and optical communications segments.
* Apple appealed the European Union's order to pay $14 billion in back taxes.
* The US stock market was slightly lower on Tuesday due to heightened geopolitical risk and fading hopes for an interest rate cut from the Federal Reserve.

Please let me know if you'd like me to summarize anything else or provide further clarification on these points.
