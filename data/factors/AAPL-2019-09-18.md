The article discusses the ongoing tax dispute between Apple Inc. and Margrethe Vestager, the EU's Competition Commissioner, over Apple's historical tax arrangements in Ireland. The case has reached the EU General Court in Luxembourg, where a decision will be made on whether the arrangement was illegal state aid.

If Apple wins, it could potentially benefit Vestager by showing that the Commission's efforts to end "sweetheart tax deals" are unsuccessful. However, if the court concludes that the arrangement was legitimate, it would undermine Vestager's ability to use state aid rules to punish countries that offer tax breaks to certain industries.

The article suggests that a ruling in Apple's favor could also help pressure the G-20 to overhaul global tax rules. The OECD has been working on a proposal to combat "base erosion and profit shifting" by multinational corporations, which allows companies to book profits in countries with more favorable tax regimes. However, there is currently no consensus among G-20 finance ministers, and Vestager would need to convince European member states to agree on a solution.

The article concludes that whether the EU or G-20 level, a victory for Apple would serve as an example of why tax reform is needed. The OECD's proposals aim to assess whether a firm has a significant economic presence in a country, taking into account factors such as local user contribution and where the product was developed.
