The W3C, a global organization that sets standards for the web, has been debating ways to prioritize privacy. A group called PING (Privacy Interest Group) within the W3C wants to give itself more power to review and block projects that don't protect user privacy. However, not all members agree with this proposal.

Google expressed concerns about PING's proposed charter, saying it would create unnecessary chaos in the development of web platform specifications. Instead, Google advocates for a formal model of privacy concerns that can be used to identify problems before they reach the review stage. The company has also proposed new ideas for improving web privacy without eliminating targeted ads.

Some critics argue that Google is being disingenuous by proposing these changes while not blocking cookies, which are a key tool for tracking users online. Princeton University researchers Jonathan Mayer and Arvind Narayanan have called this move "privacy gaslighting," suggesting that it's an attempt to persuade users and policymakers that the proposed changes aren't actually protecting privacy.

Meanwhile, other tech companies like WeChat are successfully using chat commerce, where customers can make purchases directly through text messaging. Western businesses may follow suit, potentially changing how they promote their products and interact with customers online.
