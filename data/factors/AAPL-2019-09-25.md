* Nintendo's Switch Lite console failed to meet sales expectations, selling only 114,192 units in its first three days on the market.
* Investors overreacted to this news, causing the company's stock to drop as much as 4.6% and wiping out $2.4 billion in market value.
* The article suggests that investors have an exaggerated reaction to perceptions of weakness in Nintendo gadget demand and that the contribution of hardware sales to the company's games revenue is at its lowest in three years.
* The main reason for concern about weakening hardware sales is the potential impact on software demand, but the Switch has already shown resilience in this area, with software shipments per device exceeding those of the 3DS.
* The article notes that Nintendo's titles, such as Pok√©mon Go and Mario Kart, also perform well on smartphones, further reducing concerns about the impact of a decline in console sales.
