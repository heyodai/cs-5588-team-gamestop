Based on the provided news articles, here are the top 5 factors that may affect the stock price of AAPL (Apple):

1. **Demand for new iPhone sales**: Analysts expect a "decent" demand for Apple's new iPhone, with a 5.3% decline in second-half iPhone shipments compared to Street estimates. This positive outlook on iPhone sales could boost AAPL's stock price.

2. **Supply chain revamp and potential investment in Japan Display**: Apple is considering a $186 million investment to rescue OLED screen supplier Japan Display. This move could improve the stability of Apple's supply chain, potentially supporting its stock price.

3. **Regulatory scrutiny and Microsoft's dominance**: Analyst Neil Dwane notes that investors are leaning on Microsoft (MSFT) as regulatory concerns surround some popular tech stocks. If AAPL faces similar regulatory challenges, this could impact its stock price.

4. **Services narrative and valuation multiple**: Analyst Hargreaves stated that Apple's Services narrative is largely priced in, making the stock no longer attractive relative to other large services businesses. This suggests that the growth potential of AAPL may be already factored into the stock price.

5. **Potential impact of Trump's impeachment inquiry on trade war and consumer confidence**: The markets retreated due to news of President Trump's impeachment inquiry and dismal consumer confidence data. If the trade war escalates or consumer confidence remains weak, it could negatively affect AAPL's stock price.
