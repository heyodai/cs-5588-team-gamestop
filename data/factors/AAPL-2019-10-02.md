The article discusses how PlayStation Now (PS Now) failed to live up to its potential and is now struggling to compete with other gaming services. The author suggests that Sony's strategy of offering a separate service for games streaming ($19.99/month) is too expensive compared to competitors like Netflix, Spotify, Apple Arcade, Google Stadia, and Microsoft's Xbox Game Pass (which starts at $9.99/month).

The article highlights the importance of attention in the gaming industry, where companies are competing for consumer time rather than just share of the games market. The author notes that Sony's rival, PlayStation Plus ($9.99/month), offers a more affordable option with fewer features but is still attractive to subscribers.

To improve its chances, the author suggests that Sony consider two options:

1. Fold PS Now into PlayStation Plus or offer a steep discount for customers who want both services.
2. Adopt a "all-you-can-eat" package approach like Netflix and Spotify, offering competitive pricing without sacrificing blockbuster titles.

The author believes that by taking these steps, Sony can increase its market share in the gaming subscription space and eventually reach 1.5 million paid subscribers by the end of September 2020.

Overall, the article emphasizes the importance of adaptability and competitiveness in the rapidly evolving gaming industry.
