The French government has introduced a new digital identity app called Alicem, which uses facial recognition to create secure access to various services. The app is the result of a state-mandated project to create "digital identities" for citizens, and it will be mandatory for residents to use it. Opponents have raised concerns about the lack of consent and privacy protections in the app, as well as its potential misuse by authorities.

The French government has assured that the facial recognition data collected through Alicem will be deleted after the enrollment process is complete, but critics argue that this does not address the underlying issues with mass surveillance. The app's development comes at a time when many countries are rushing to create their own digital identity systems, often using facial recognition technology.

In Europe, the use of facial recognition for digital identity has been met with skepticism due to concerns about privacy and consent. France is not alone in its efforts, as other countries such as Singapore and India also use facial recognition technology for similar purposes.

The EU's new Commission has set out its goals for building a "Europe fit for the Digital Age," which includes mastering Artificial Intelligence technologies like facial recognition. The wide-spread use of facial recognition raises questions about regulators' ability to keep pace with new technologies, and whether France is overstepping its mark or using the most secure technology available.
