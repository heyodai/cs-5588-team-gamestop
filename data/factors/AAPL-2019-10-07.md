Here's a summary of the article:

Osram, a German lighting company, is engaged in a takeover battle with private equity firms Bain and Carlyle. The deal was initially reported to be worth â‚¬9 billion but AMS (Austria-based sensor specialist) has since lobbed a higher bid. Osram has confirmed talks with both Bain and Carlyle, while also exploring other strategic options.

The merger would bring together two companies that have been pivoting in recent years under Chief Executive Officer Olaf Berlien to focus on high-growth products like iris scanners and infrared emitters. The deal is seen as a key move by AMS to strengthen its presence in the lighting market.

However, Osram unions and employee representatives have expressed concerns about promised synergies and the deal's financing, while management has also been critical of the plan. Despite this, AMS remains committed to exploring strategic options for a takeover.

Osram's shares were down 5% on Wednesday following the news, reflecting uncertainty around the outcome of the bid process.
