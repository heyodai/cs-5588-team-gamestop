The article discusses the challenges facing electric vehicle (EV) startups and traditional automakers in the industry. The Dyson decision, which announced plans to invest $3.1 billion in new technology, has raised concerns about the viability of start-ups like NIO Inc., Lifan Industry Group Co., and Zotye Automobile Co. in China.

The article notes that the competition is getting tougher as traditional automakers such as General Motors Co. and Volkswagen AG are investing heavily in electrification. Apple Inc. also has an automotive project, although it has scaled back its ambitions.

Experts have questioned the feasibility of Dyson's plans to build an electric car plant in Singapore, citing high labor costs and the fact that other companies are building plants in China at a fraction of the cost.

The article concludes that while Singapore is keen on attracting start-ups and advanced technology companies, it may not be able to compete with the vast resources available in China. The family office of James Dyson has incorporated in Singapore and is hiring IT and finance staff, but economists are skeptical about its prospects.
