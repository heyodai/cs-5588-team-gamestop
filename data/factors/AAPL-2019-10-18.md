The Taiwanese company TSMC, the world's largest contract chipmaker, has increased its estimate for 2019 capital expenditure to between $14 billion to $15 billion from as much as $11 billion previously. The company's Chief Financial Officer, Wendell Huang, said that 2020 spending will be similar, and that the emergence of 5G technology will help underpin the business in coming years.

TSMC projects current-quarter revenue ahead of estimates, an affirmation that the latest iPhones have proven a hit with consumers. The company also increased its forecast of the 5G smartphone penetration rate in 2020 to a percentage in the mid-teens from its previous single-digit estimate.

The company's capital spending plan and outlook prompted price-target hikes from several analysts, including Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley. TSMC's shares, which notched a lifetime high just this month, stood largely unchanged Friday in Taipei.

Analysts believe that TSMC's push is driven by growing demand from tech giants such as Apple and Huawei Technologies Co., and that the global semiconductor market is set to make a gradual recovery on the back of the demand related to 5G, AI, and automotive applications. However, fallout from ongoing trade conflicts could crimp an industry revival.

TSMC's forecast of revenue for the December holiday quarter surpassed an average projection for about $9.9 billion, and the company is straining against capacity constraints in the current quarter. The "iPhone is driving stronger near-term demand," said Sanford C. Bernstein analyst Mark Li, adding that Apple is placing more orders at the supply chain due to the competitive pricing of iPhone 11.

The emergence of 5G technology is seen as a key driver of the semiconductor industry's growth, and TSMC's increased investment in capital expenditure reflects its confidence in this trend. The company's CEO, C.C. Wei, stated that "we are much more optimistic than six months ago" regarding the prospects for the tech industry.

Overall, TSMC's decision to increase its capital expenditure is seen as a smart bet by analysts, who believe that the company is poised to benefit from the growth in demand for 5G-enabled smartphones and other technologies.
