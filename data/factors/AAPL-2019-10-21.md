The article discusses the challenges faced by Japan Display (JDI), a Japanese display manufacturer that produces LCDs and OLEDs for smartphones, tablets, and other devices. JDI has been struggling financially due to increased competition from South Korean and Chinese rivals, and its own failure to invest in LCD capacity on time.

Despite repeated attempts to secure funding, JDI is facing significant financial difficulties, with five straight years of losses. The company's stock price has plummeted, and it has already lost several potential investors. However, JDI still hopes to raise fresh capital from overseas investors, including Oasis Management Co., which may invest $200 million.

The article also mentions that Apple supplier JDI is close to having its first OLED product, which will be used in the Apple Watch. This marks a significant development for JDI, as competing in the mobile phone market would require billions of dollars in additional investment.

The article quotes Japan Display's CEO Kikuoka, who acknowledges that the company made mistakes in the past, such as over-investing in factories at the peak of demand and becoming complacent due to being backed by a state-owned fund. Kikuoka emphasizes the need for JDI to adapt to changing market conditions and invest in new technologies to remain competitive.

Overall, the article highlights the challenges faced by JDI and the importance of adapting to changing market conditions to remain competitive. It also underscores the significance of Apple's move to use OLED screens in its iPhone 11 lineup and the potential impact on JDI's business.
