The article discusses how Hyunho Sohn, portfolio manager of FIL Investment Management's Fidelity Global Technology fund, has raised bets on Samsung Electronics Co. as the largest holding in his portfolio. He believes that despite a sharp decline in share price at the end of 2018, Samsung's fundamentals are strong and it is an undervalued stock with long-term growth potential.

Key points:

*   Hyunho Sohn's fund has beaten 98% of its peers with an annualized return of about 20% over the past five years.
*   The fund's top holdings include Alphabet, Apple, Intel Corp., and Microsoft Corp.
*   Samsung's forward price-to-earnings ratio is 12.6 times, which is not cheap compared to historical averages but still lags peers like Micron Technology Inc. and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company.
*   Shares of Samsung have risen about 30% this year as overseas investors bought net 4.3 trillion won ($3.6 billion) of shares.
*   Sohn believes in the long-term growth potential of the tech giant, citing the growing needs of cloud storage and service providers alongside the artificial intelligence industry.

However, there are also challenges for the memory chip sector, including:

1.  **Mixed Chip Prices**: Contract prices for certain types of memory chips have been mixed, with some falling while others rising.
2.  **Micron's Disappointing Sales Forecasts**: Micron Technology Inc., the third-largest player in the industry, released disappointing sales forecasts last month.
3.  **Samsung's Third-Quarter Preliminary Earnings Guidance**: The company's guidance is less than half of its operating profits a year earlier.

Despite these challenges, Sohn remains optimistic about Samsung and believes that it has long-term growth potential.
