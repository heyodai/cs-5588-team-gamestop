* Despite this, some companies, such as HSBC Holdings Plc, are already allowing clients to open accounts with selfies.
* The use of facial recognition cameras is also becoming more widespread in Hong Kong, including outside buildings and on streets where riot police have been deployed.
* However, protesters have been using face masks to avoid being identified by the cameras, and some companies have pulled out of projects due to fear of backlash.
