Here is a summary of the article:

TikTok, the popular short video app run by Chinese company ByteDance, saw its global user downloads fall for the first time in two years, according to new data from Sensor Tower. The app's user growth declined 4% in the third quarter, marking the first decline on a quarterly basis since its launch. TikTok has been installed by around 564 million users so far this year and has reached 1.45 billion installs since launching. The decline in user growth comes as ByteDance appears to have scaled back its advertising spending on Facebook and other platforms. This trend is seen as a sign of the company's efforts to focus on monetization rather than simply growing its user base.
