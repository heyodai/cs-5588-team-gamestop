The article discusses the potential sale of The Daily Telegraph by its current owner, Paul Zwillenberg, chief executive officer of the Daily Mail and General Trust Plc. The article notes that the newspaper's valuation is in question, with some estimates suggesting it could be worth as much as 665 million pounds ($854 million), while others believe a more realistic value would be around 200 million pounds.

The article points out that the newspaper's decline in readership and advertising revenue has made it challenging to justify such a high price. The Daily Telegraph's operating profit fell to 7.8 million pounds last year, which is significantly lower than the 32 million pounds it generated in 2004 when the Barclay brothers first bought it.

The article suggests that the only way for the owners to achieve their asking price would be to find a billionaire who is looking to exert outsized influence on the negotiations to exit the European Union. The Daily Telegraph and Sunday Telegraph remain influential voices on the right of British politics, and a strategic buyer could potentially justify paying a premium for their media assets.

However, the article notes that even if Britain's initial deal to leave the EU passes parliament, there may be a transition period of negotiations stretching to the end of 2022. This raises questions about whether the purchase price is justified, especially given the uncertainty surrounding Brexit.

The article also touches on the issue of quality journalism and the potential impact of a single-issue agenda on the media industry. It suggests that finding a buyer who can provide long-term support for high-quality journalism would be more beneficial than pursuing a short-term gain from a single-issue agenda.

Overall, the article highlights the challenges of valuing The Daily Telegraph's worth in today's media landscape and the need for careful consideration of the potential buyers' motivations and goals.
