The article discusses Huawei's struggles due to US sanctions, particularly the ban on using US technology and software. The company has seen a significant impact on its business, including a 24% surge in revenue and a 26% jump in smartphone shipments to 185 million units. However, the ban has also affected other aspects of Huawei's operations, such as its server business, which is expected to generate $8 billion in revenue this year, but will be cut in half.

To mitigate the impact of the ban, Huawei is exploring ways to get around a Google blockade and develop its own operating system, HarmonyOS. The company has also introduced an open-source version of Android for its Mate 30 series and is offering $1.5 billion to lure global developers to create software for its ecosystem.

The article also mentions that a significant part of Huawei's products have been affected by the ban, with 20% to 40% of its products impacted. The company's chairman, Ren Zhengfei, has predicted that the US sanctions could knock $30 billion off his company's revenue, but he later revised down this estimate to less than $10 billion.

The article concludes that Huawei is facing a delicate geopolitical situation and needs to be "very agile and careful" as it navigates this challenging environment.
