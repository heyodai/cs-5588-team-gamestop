The article discusses TikTok's lobbying efforts in the United States, specifically hiring a law firm called Monument Advocacy to help navigate concerns about national security and data privacy. The move is seen as part of TikTok's effort to calm U.S. regulators and policymakers who are scrutinizing the app due to its Chinese ownership and potential for foreign interference.

TikTok has been expanding its operations in the United States, hiring staff in major cities like Los Angeles, San Francisco, Chicago, and New York. The company has also logged over 564 million installations this year and has been downloaded 1.45 billion times since launching.

U.S. officials are reviewing whether ByteDance's purchase of social media startup Musical.ly poses a national security risk, and lawmakers have expressed concerns about foreign interference in American elections and the security of user data on the app.

The company has rejected the notion that it is controlled by the Chinese government or that U.S. user data is at risk, stating that "TikTok does not operate in China, nor do we have any intention of doing so in the future."

TikTok's lobbying efforts include hiring Covington & Burling, a law firm with ties to former politicians and industry leaders. The company has also registered its in-house lobbyist Eric Ebenstein and brought on K&L Gates LLP to advise it on policies around transparency and content moderation.

Overall, the article suggests that TikTok is taking steps to address concerns about national security and data privacy in the United States, but some lawmakers remain skeptical of the app's intentions.
