The article discusses how Apple has decided to remove all vaping-related apps from the App Store, citing concerns over public health and safety. The move has been seen as heavy-handed by some, particularly third-party sellers who use Amazon's Fulfillment by Amazon (FBA) service.

Amazon, in response to Apple's decision, stated that it doesn't distinguish between brands when listing shopping results, and that its algorithm for listing products doesn't consider whether a merchant uses FBA or sells private-label products. Amazon also emphasized that it prohibits its private-label business from using individual sellers' data to make decisions about product introductions, pricing, or inventory.

The article highlights the irony of Apple's decision, given that vaping apps were never particularly popular among consumers. The removal of these apps is seen as an overreaction by some, who argue that it will disproportionately affect small businesses and third-party sellers who use Amazon's services.

The article also notes that other tech companies, such as Google and Spotify, are facing similar challenges in regulating their platforms, particularly when it comes to issues like misinformation and hate speech.
