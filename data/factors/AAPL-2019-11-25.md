The article discusses Amazon's recent change to its product review system, which allows customers to rate products with a one- to five-star rating. The company is attempting to curb gamesmanship by third-party sellers who pay for fake reviews and try to break the rules. However, the new system prioritizes customer rankings over traditional reviews, which some critics see as a half-measure.

The article quotes Tristan Harris, co-founder of the Center for Humane Technology, who expresses skepticism about Amazon's efforts, saying that it's not enough to simply change feedback loops and that the company needs to fundamentally rethink its approach to online reviews.

However, others see the changes as a positive step towards improving the review system. The article notes that the new system still allows customers to easily find reviews, even if they were created by fake reviewers or content farms.

The article also mentions other tech companies that have made similar efforts to improve their review systems, such as Instagram and Twitter, but has not yet fully disavowed them altogether.

Overall, the article presents a nuanced view of Amazon's changes, acknowledging both the potential benefits and limitations of the new system.
