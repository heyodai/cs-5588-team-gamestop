The EU is considering introducing a digital tax to address the low corporate tax rate faced by many digital companies in the bloc. The proposed tax would apply to companies with global revenues of over $700 million and could be worth up to 3% of their profits. 

Several European countries, including France, Germany, Italy, and Spain, have already introduced or are planning to introduce their own digital taxes. The EU aims to harmonize these rules to ensure a level playing field for businesses.

The proposed digital tax would apply to companies with global revenues exceeding $700 million. Companies in the bloc would be subject to the tax if they generate profits from digital activities that are not taxed by their home country or other countries where they operate.

Some EU countries, including Germany and Spain, have already introduced their own digital taxes. France's finance minister has called the US tariff plans "unacceptable" and said they are not worthy of an ally.
