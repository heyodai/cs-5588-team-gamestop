China Evergrande Group, a property developer, has announced plans to become the world's biggest manufacturer of electric vehicles (EVs) within three to five years. This ambitious goal surpasses Tesla, which recently opened its first factory in Shanghai.

Evergrande has invested over $3.8 billion in EV-related companies between September 2018 and June 2019, according to Bloomberg Intelligence. The company plans to spend 45 billion yuan on new-energy vehicles between 2019 and 2021.

However, Evergrande's CEO, Hui Ka Yan, acknowledges that the company faces significant challenges due to its lack of experience, technology, and production base in manufacturing cars. To overcome these hurdles, Hui has stated that he will "buy whatever core technology and company" is needed to compete with established automakers.

This strategy may take a toll on Evergrande's finances, as investing in EVs can be cash-burning. Analyst Kristy Hung warned that the company's forecast of spending 45 billion yuan might underestimate its actual expenditure, which could exacerbate its cash crunch and impact its home-sales margin.

Meanwhile, Baidu Inc., China's dominant internet search-engine company, has made WM Motor Technology Co. part of its move into autonomous driving. Baidu led a fundraising round that generated 3 billion yuan for the Shanghai-based automaker and owns a 13% stake.

Other automotive news includes:

* Volvo parent Zhejiang Geely Holding Group has sued WM Motor Technology Co., seeking 2.1 billion yuan compensation for alleged copyright infringement.
* Rolls-Royce, a subsidiary of BMW, is auctioning off a bespoke red Phantom to benefit HIV/AIDS programs, with the winning bidder able to collaborate with artist Mickalene Thomas on a custom wrap.

These developments highlight the growing competition in the EV industry and the strategies being employed by companies like Evergrande and Baidu to stay ahead.
