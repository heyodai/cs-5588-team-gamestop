The U.S. government has uncovered a classified file from the Patriot missile program in a search of an Apple engineer's home while he was under investigation for stealing trade secrets for a Chinese startup.

Jizhong Chen, who is accused of stealing photos, schematics and manuals from his work on Apple's self-driving car project, had a stash of sensitive documents found at his Maryland home. The document, which belongs to Chen's former employer Raytheon Co., was deemed "classified national security materials" by prosecutors.

The government has asked the district judge to order location monitoring for Chen due to concerns that he may try to flee before his trial. However, lawyers representing Chen and another former Apple engineer facing similar charges argue that the risk of escape is exaggerated and that their clients have strong ties in the U.S.

Chen is awaiting trial on charges related to collecting sensitive information from his former employers, including General Electric and Raytheon Co. He has pleaded not guilty and remains free on $500,000 bail.

The discovery of the classified document has added a national security wrinkle to the corporate espionage case, and prosecutors are seeking to keep Chen under close scrutiny. The government argues that Chen's possession of classified information for over eight years is a serious offense.

Lawyers for Chen and Zhang Xiaolang, another former Apple engineer accused of stealing trade secrets, argue that there is no evidence that Apple's intellectual property was shared with a third party and that their clients have strong ties in the U.S. They contend that the government's argument that Zhang poses a flight risk because he is a Chinese citizen is insufficient to warrant GPS monitoring.

The cases are ongoing, and a hearing is set for Monday.
