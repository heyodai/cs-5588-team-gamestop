The article discusses Apple's (AAPL) recent surge in value, with its share price reaching a new record high of $280.41 per share. Merrill Lynch analyst Wamsi Mohan is bullish on the company, citing reasons such as:

* Inexpensive valuation
* Strong demand for iPhones
* Attractively priced wearables portfolio
* Demographic changes in Apple's favor
* Strong cash flow and capital returns

Mohan expects Apple to launch at least one model of the iPhone with 5G capability in the fall of 2020, which could drive strong growth. He also estimates that Apple's sales will reach over 200 million per year between 2020-2022.

The analyst reiterates a Buy rating on Apple and bumps up the price target from $270 to $290, implying further upside of 4%.

While Mohan's bullish stance is shared by some analysts, not all are convinced that Apple has reached its peak. The current consensus among analysts is a Moderate Buy, with an average price target of $263.52.

The article also mentions that Apple currently ranks as a Moderate Buy, with a breakdown of 20 Buys, 10 Holds, and 3 Sells from analysts tracked over the last 3 months.
