This article is about the resurgence of San Jose, California as a hub for tech companies and development, thanks in part to a Trump-era tax break known as the Opportunity Zone program. The city has long been overshadowed by Silicon Valley, but with Google planning a new campus and other developers taking advantage of the tax incentives, San Jose is seeing a surge in new developments.

The article highlights Erik Hayden, a developer who has become one of the most-active developers in California's third-largest city, laying out plans for apartments, offices, a Marriott-branded hotel, and even a senior-living facility. Hayden credits the Opportunity Zone program with making downtown San Jose more attractive to investors.

However, the article also notes that the real estate boom has provoked a backlash from residents who are worried that the arrival of thousands of tech workers will put housing out of reach in one of the more affordable parts of the Bay Area. Median home prices have moderated since 2018, but concerns about affordability remain.

The article quotes Nate Jensen, a professor of government at the University of Texas at Austin, who notes that it's difficult to evaluate the effectiveness of the Opportunity Zone program because there is no way to know whether investments would have happened without the tax breaks. Erik Hallgrimson, a broker with Cushman & Wakefield in San Jose, acknowledges that the opportunity zone benefits are "without question" important for some new developments.

Overall, the article suggests that while the Opportunity Zone program has been successful in attracting investment to areas like San Jose, it's also sparked concerns about affordability and gentrification.
