Samsung Electronics aims to become a leading foundry in the semiconductor industry by leveraging its experience building chips and devices, as well as its ability to package memory and logic chips into a single module. The company plans to spend $10 billion per year on equipment, research and development over the next decade, with capital expenditure of around $14 billion for this year and next.

Samsung's goal is to reach 5-nanometer production processes with extreme ultraviolet (EUV) technology in the new year, which would put it directly competing with Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. (TSMC), its main rival in the foundry business. However, TSMC has already taken over Apple's A-series processor manufacturing from Samsung, and TSMC is expected to reach 5-nanometer production processes with EUV before Samsung.

To win over clients, top Samsung executives are touring major cities, hosting foundry forums, and negotiating deals. The company believes its competitive edge lies in its ability to foresee and address the engineering requirements of its clients, as well as its ability to package memory and logic chips into a single module.

Analysts warn that some companies may be wary about outsourcing production to a direct competitor in the consumer electronics market, lest Samsung learns and copies their chip designs in its own products. However, if Samsung can move ahead technologically, it is expected to find no shortage of customers for its varied semiconductor offerings.

The company has already established relationships with major clients, such as Vivo, which agreed to buy 5G Exynos chips from Samsung. Additionally, Samsung is competing with foundry customer Sony Corp. in the growing market for image sensors, having unveiled an unprecedented 108-megapixel camera for smartphones.

TSMC and Samsung are expected to reach 5-nanometer production processes with EUV in the new year, which means they will have only each other to compete with in a market that is only set to expand. Once they ramp up and achieve economies of scale, the overall process cycle time is likely to decrease by 20% and the foundry capacity output will increase by 25%, according to a Citigroup Inc. research report.

Overall, Samsung's success in the foundry business depends on its ability to position itself technologically and address the concerns of its clients.
