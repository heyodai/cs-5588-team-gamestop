The article discusses how US companies, including internet giants and American politicians, need to consider how their actions may be perceived by other countries with different values and norms. The author suggests that it's long overdue for Americans and US political representatives to take seriously the potential impact of their digital interactions on global attitudes.

The article also notes that Chinese hardware companies like Huawei, Xiaomi, Lenovo, and DJI Innovations have had success outside of China, while pure internet companies face trickier standards of norms and laws. The author is not considering services provided by Chinese companies like Didi and Alibaba, which use the internet and smartphones to provide real-world services.

The article concludes with a column from Shira Ovide, who suggests that US investors should look at Qorvo (QRVO) as a potential winner in 2020 due to its role in the booming 5G smartphone market, thriving WiFi-6 cycle, and increasing adoption of GaN solutions.
