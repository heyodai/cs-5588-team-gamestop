The article discusses the current state of Vietnam's economy and stock market. While Vietnam has been hailed as a winner in the current U.S.-China trade spat due to its rapid growth and relocation of production from China, the country's stock market is not reflecting this enthusiasm.

The main reasons for this are:

1. Dominance of banks: The Vietnamese stock market is dominated by banks, with average return on equity (ROE) at 15%. However, bank loans have already exceeded Vietnam's GDP level, making it difficult for banks to raise capital without increasing bad debt.
2. Strict foreign ownership limits: The government imposes a 30% foreign ownership limit on banks, making it challenging for outsiders to buy into the sector. This has led to a lack of liquidity in the market and high premiums being paid by foreigners trading with each other.
3. Over-reliance on Vingroup: The company's dominance (accounting for almost 15% of the index) is problematic due to its land acquisition issues, which have slowed down growth potential.

As a result, Vietnam's stock market is becoming increasingly dominated by debt-ridden banks and lacking in New Economy technology stocks. This has raised concerns that the country's economy will eventually slow down, making it essential for Vietnam to remove protectionist policies and open up its economy to real growth.

The article concludes that if outsiders lose interest in a broken system like China's, Vietnam needs to address these issues before they become too severe.
