Based on the article, it seems that Walmart's focus on strengthening its e-commerce business and increasing store traffic may help drive sales growth in Fiscal 4Q18. Analysts expect strong sales in the US segment to drive Walmart's top-line growth.

Walmart has been investing heavily in its cloud computing capabilities, which enables the company to crunch large amounts of customer data in-house. This effort is helping Walmart to stay competitive with Amazon on pricing and to tightly control key functions such as inventory.

Additionally, Walmart's online sales have been growing rapidly over the past few quarters, outpacing wider industry growth levels. The company has also made a bold move into the health care market by offering free shipping and partnering with pharmaceutical companies.

However, it is worth noting that Amazon is also making moves in the health care space, including pushing to turn its nascent medical-supplies business into a major supplier to U.S. hospitals and outpatient clinics. This could potentially impact Walmart's sales growth and competitiveness in the market.

Overall, while Walmart's efforts may help drive sales growth in Fiscal 4Q18, it is likely that Amazon will continue to be a significant competitor in the e-commerce space, particularly in areas such as health care and cloud computing.
