Based on the provided article snippets, I will identify some key points that could help spot when the selling is over:

1. **Amazon's cloud business growth**: The mention of Amazon Web Services (AWS) and its significant growth suggests a promising future for the company.
2. **Increased competition from Alphabet/Google**: The article highlights Google's efforts to make a dent in the enterprise market, which could lead to increased competition and potentially impact Amazon's stock price.
3. **Netflix's Oscar win and relationship with Hollywood**: While Netflix's Oscar win is a positive event, the article also mentions that its relationship with Hollywood is still strained, which could be a concern for investors.
4. **Walmart's e-commerce growth**: The mention of Walmart's digital sales growth and its ability to compete with Amazon in e-commerce suggests a potential shift in the retail landscape.
5. **Target's success in e-commerce**: Target's ability to keep pace with Walmart in e-commerce could be a positive sign for investors, as it suggests that Amazon may not be the only player in the market.

These points suggest that while there are some challenges and uncertainties in the tech industry, there are also opportunities for growth and investment. When considering whether the selling is over, you may want to look for signs of:

* Improved earnings forecasts
* Increased investor confidence
* Decreased concern about competition from Alphabet/Google or Netflix
* Growing demand for Amazon's cloud services or e-commerce capabilities

However, it's essential to note that the tech industry can be unpredictable, and there are always potential risks and challenges. A thorough analysis of financial statements, industry trends, and company performance is necessary before making any investment decisions.
