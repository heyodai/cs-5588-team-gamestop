President Donald Trump has ordered a review of the United States Postal Service (USPS) business practices and finances, following criticism from Amazon that the USPS is giving the online retailer a sweetheart deal. The task force will look into the post office's business model and aim to prevent a taxpayer-funded bailout.

The order was signed by Trump on Thursday night, and it comes after he had previously tweeted that Amazon was underpaying the USPS for package deliveries. The tweets were widely criticized as unsubstantiated claims, but they seem to have sparked Trump's action.

The task force will be led by the Deputy Secretary of Transportation, Samira Arora, and will consist of experts from various government agencies, including the Department of Agriculture, the Federal Communications Commission, and the General Services Administration. The review is expected to focus on the post office's financial performance, its business model, and any potential conflicts of interest.

The move is seen as a response to Trump's criticism of Amazon, which has been a frequent target for his anger over the past few years. Some have speculated that the task force may be an attempt by Trump to address concerns about Amazon's dominance in the package delivery market.

Amazon was not directly mentioned in the order, but it appears that the company's relationship with the USPS is still a contentious issue. The company has been accused of using its vast resources to influence the USPS's pricing and business practices, which could give it an unfair advantage over competitors like Walmart and eBay.

The task force's findings are expected to be released in the coming months, and they may shed some light on the USPS's financial struggles and how they relate to Amazon.
