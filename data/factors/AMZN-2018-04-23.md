Amazon Web Services (AWS) has launched AWS Blockchain Templates, a service that provides pre-set blockchain frameworks for developers to create and deploy secure blockchain networks using open-source frameworks. The new product supports two versions of the technology: Ethereum and the Linux Foundation's Hyperledger Fabric. This move marks AWS' entry into the blockchain space, where it will compete with similar offerings from IBM Corp. (IBM) and Oracle Corp. (ORCL).
