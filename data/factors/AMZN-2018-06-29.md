The article discusses Amazon's acquisition of PillPack, an online pharmacy that allows customers to have their prescription drugs delivered directly to their homes. The acquisition is valued at $1 billion and marks a significant move by Amazon into the mail-order pharmacy business.

Pharmacies may be concerned about this development for several reasons:

1. **Disruption to the traditional pharmacy model**: PillPack's online service could potentially disrupt the traditional pharmacy model, which relies on in-store visits and manual prescription filling.
2. **Increased competition**: With Amazon now offering a similar service, pharmacies may face increased competition for customers' business.
3. **Potential disruption of supply chains**: Amazon's acquisition of PillPack could also impact the supply chain of medications, as the company would be able to negotiate directly with pharmaceutical manufacturers and control the flow of medication delivery.

However, it's worth noting that PillPack's CEO TJ Parker has stated that his company is not trying to replace traditional pharmacies but rather provide a convenient and cost-effective option for patients who take multiple prescription drugs. Additionally, Amazon's acquisition of PillPack could also lead to more efficient and streamlined healthcare services in the long run.

Overall, while the acquisition may be unsettling for some pharmacies, it also presents an opportunity for innovation and improvement in the pharmacy industry.
