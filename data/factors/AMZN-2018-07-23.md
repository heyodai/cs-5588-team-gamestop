1. **Amazon stock**: Morgan Stanley likes Amazon stock even at all-time highs, citing strong company fundamentals and industry trends. Amazon is expected to release second-quarter earnings on July 26.

3. **Apple vs. Amazon**: Apple needs only a 6% increase in stock price to reach $1 trillion market capitalization, but Amazon's valuation also approaches this milestone.
4. **FAANG stocks**: The tech sector is expected to remain hot into the end of 2018, with FAANG stocks (Facebook, Amazon, Apple, Netflix, and Google) likely to continue their upward trend.
5. **Sonos IPO**: Sonos plans to raise up to $264 million in its initial public offering, but faces increased competition in the wireless speaker market.
6. **Netflix valuation**: Netflix's valuation needs to "chill" due to increasing competition from Disney and other companies, and a fair value estimate of $120 per share has been raised.
7. **Amazon, Toyota, Alcoa, and others vs. Trump's tariff plans**: Big companies are working to counter the effect of the Trump administration's trade policies and avoid confrontation with the President.
