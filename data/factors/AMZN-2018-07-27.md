Amazon has reported its highest profit margin in years, with profits topping $2 billion for the first time. The company's cloud-computing business, advertising offerings, and services to sellers on its site have driven this growth, as executives confirmed that investments are starting to pay off.

The company's stock price surged after the earnings report, beating expectations by 104%. This represents an extraordinary growth rate for such a large company.

Amazon Web Services (AWS) revenue also saw significant gains, increasing by 49% year-over-year. AWS remains vital to Amazon's growth and remains one of its most profitable businesses.

Additionally, United Natural Foods (UNFI), a supplier to Whole Foods, has acquired SuperValu for $2.9 billion.

Amazon's higher margins were highlighted as a key aspect of the Q2 earnings report, with diluted earnings per share reaching $5.07, more than doubling expectations.

The company's momentum and growth rate have been described by Boomerang CEO Guru Hariharan as a "snowball effect," highlighting Amazon's continued success in various areas.
