The article appears to be a collection of unrelated news articles and topics related to technology and business. However, I can help you summarize some of the key points:

1. **Cortana struggles**: Cortana, Microsoft's digital assistant, was introduced four years ago but has struggled to gain traction due to its limited availability on non-Windows operating systems.
2. **Alexa dominates smart speakers**: Amazon's Alexa digital assistant now controls two-thirds of the U.S. smart-speaker market, according to research firm eMarketer.
3. **Stock market struggles**: The S&P 500 has failed to close above its previous record high set in January 2018, despite being a broad market barometer for U.S. stocks.
4. **Microsoft's cloud business thrives**: Microsoft's smaller cloud business, Amazon Web Services (AWS), is its most profitable segment due to higher margins, and the company is growing rapidly in this area.

Overall, the articles suggest that Microsoft is experiencing growth in its cloud business, while Amazon faces challenges from its smart-speaker market share. Cortana struggles to compete with Alexa, and the stock market has not reached a new high despite being a strong indicator of the overall economy.
