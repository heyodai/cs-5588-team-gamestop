There is no specific question or topic being discussed, but rather a collection of news articles about various companies and their activities. 

However, if I had to infer a potential topic for discussion based on the content, it could be:

**"The Rise of E-commerce and Cloud Computing: How Companies Like Amazon Are Changing The Game"**

This topic could cover the various ways in which Amazon is expanding its business into new areas, such as cloud computing, advertising, and banking, and how these changes are impacting other companies and industries. It could also explore the implications of this trend for consumers, employees, and regulators.

Alternatively, a potential discussion question could be:

**"How do you think Amazon's expansion into new markets, such as Turkey and banking, will affect its business model and overall strategy?"**

This question could lead to a discussion about the benefits and risks associated with Amazon's global expansion, including the potential for increased competition, regulatory challenges, and opportunities for growth.
