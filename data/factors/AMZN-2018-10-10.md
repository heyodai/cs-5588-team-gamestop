Here are three reasons why Netflix stock is a buy ahead of Q3 earnings:

1. **Growing Subscriber Base**: Netflix has been consistently adding new subscribers, with its last quarter showing over 22 million new additions. This growth trend is expected to continue, as more people turn to streaming services for entertainment.
2. **Increased Revenue from New Content**: Netflix has been investing heavily in new original content, including popular shows like "Stranger Things" and "The Crown." This increased content library will likely lead to higher revenue from subscription fees, with analysts expecting a significant increase in earnings per share (EPS).
3. **Improved International Expansion**: Netflix has been expanding its presence in international markets, with a focus on emerging economies like India and Latin America. This expansion is expected to drive growth for the company, as it taps into new consumer bases and increases revenue streams.

These factors suggest that Netflix stock has strong potential for growth ahead of Q3 earnings, making it a buy for investors looking for a promising streaming service.
