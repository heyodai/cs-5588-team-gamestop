Amazon plans to split its second headquarters, dubbed "HQ2," evenly between two cities: New York City's Long Island City neighborhood and Arlington, Virginia's Crystal City area. This decision was made to recruit top tech talent, as Amazon has satellite operations around the world and needs access to a large pool of skilled workers.

The company is holding advanced talks with several finalists, including Dallas, Texas, and Washington, D.C.'s surrounding areas. The plan would divide the 50,000 new jobs expected from HQ2 evenly between the two locations, making each city home to approximately 25,000 employees.

Amazon's decision to split HQ2 rather than choosing a single location is likely driven by its need for access to top tech talent and its desire to create a more balanced workforce. While this move may bring benefits, such as increased diversity and access to new markets, it also raises questions about the impact on local communities and the potential strain on resources.

As of now, Amazon has declined to comment on the news, which was first reported by The Wall Street Journal.
