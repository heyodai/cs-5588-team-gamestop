It appears that the City Councilman was questioning the amount of incentives (EDGE incentives) being offered to Mike's Hard Lemonade maker, but there is no specific information about the number or value of the incentives provided. However, I can provide some context and related information.

The EDGE program is a tax incentive program offered by the state of Tennessee that provides financial assistance to companies that locate or expand in certain areas of the state. The program offers incentives such as grants, tax credits, and other forms of support to help companies create jobs and stimulate economic growth.

According to reports, Mike's Hard Lemonade maker received a large grant from the EDGE program to create 30 new jobs in Memphis, Tennessee. However, I couldn't find specific information about the exact amount of the grant or the total value of the incentives provided.

In contrast, Amazon is reportedly receiving a much larger package of incentives from the state and Nashville Metro for its planned second headquarters. According to reports, Amazon's incentive package includes:

* A $25 million grant
* $161 million in tax credits
* Other forms of support, including infrastructure investment and job training programs

It's worth noting that while the amount of incentives may be larger for Amazon, the number of jobs created by Mike's Hard Lemonade maker is significantly lower (30 vs. 5,000). The City Councilman's question may be related to whether the incentives being offered to Mike's Hard Lemonade maker are proportionate to the number of jobs they plan to create.
