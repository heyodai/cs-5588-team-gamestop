The article discusses IBM's recent transformation under the leadership of Arvind Krishna and the introduction of Red Hat, which has given the company a path towards profitable growth. The article highlights that IBM stock has long been among the cheapest tech shares but only because it wasn't growing. However, with the recent fourth quarter results indicating that IBM can grow, the stock becomes a real bargain.

The article also mentions that IBM's revenue is still twice that of Oracle and its market cap is 50% higher than IBM's, while having a dividend yield two-thirds smaller. This suggests that IBM has a strong financial position compared to Oracle.

Additionally, the article compares IBM's performance to Oracle's, noting that despite being more profitable in terms of revenue, Oracle's stock price is lower due to its lower dividend yield.

Overall, the article presents a positive view on IBM's prospects and the potential for its stock to rise as it grows.
