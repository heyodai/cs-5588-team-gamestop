Amazon.com is scheduled to report its fourth-quarter financial results after the market closes on Thursday. Here's a snapshot of Wall Street's expectations and some recent history:

*   Amazon's earnings figures will show how worried companies such as Netflix and Google should be as Amazon pushes into their turf.

    *   The company has been expanding its offerings in areas like cloud computing (AWS), advertising, and e-commerce, which could impact the financial performance of rivals.
*   Wall Street expects Amazon to report a larger-than-expected increase in revenue for the fourth quarter, with some analysts projecting earnings per share (EPS) of $3.60.

    *   The company's strong brand recognition and extensive network of delivery stations have helped it maintain its market position.
*   Some investors are paying close attention to whether Amazon will continue to expand its Whole Foods Market chain and Prime Now delivery service into the suburbs, as this could impact the company's growth prospects.
*   Amazon has been investing heavily in its artificial intelligence capabilities, including Alexa, which could have a significant impact on the company's long-term financial performance.

    *   The company is also expected to continue expanding its advertising business, which could provide a new revenue stream for the company.
