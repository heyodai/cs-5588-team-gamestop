The articles discuss Amazon's record sales and profit during the holiday season, as well as its cloud computing business, advertising fees, and merchant services.

The key points mentioned in these articles include:

* Amazon's quarterly profit topped $3 billion for the first time

* However, Amazon's sales outlook fell short after the record holiday quarter, with shares falling 5% to $1,635 after the bell
* The company's international segment revenue (61% of total revenue) rose 18% to $44.12 billion, while its International segment saw revenue grow 15% to $20.83 billion
* Amazon's cloud computing business and advertising fees have fattened the company's once-thin profit margin
* The company has been taming its operating costs and has been focusing on profitable businesses like cloud computing, advertising, and merchant services
* However, uncertainty in India and a possible uptick in spending threaten to cut short Amazon's streak of record profits.

Overall, these articles suggest that while Amazon had a strong holiday season and beat Wall Street's sales and earnings projections, the company's growth prospects may be more mixed, with challenges in its international markets and potential for increased spending.
