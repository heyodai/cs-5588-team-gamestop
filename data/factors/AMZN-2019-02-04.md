There is no clear answer to the prompt as it appears to be a collection of news articles and stock market analysis. However, I can try to identify some potential opportunities or trends mentioned in the articles:

1. **Amazon's expansion in Brazil**: Amazon has started direct sales of merchandise beyond books in Brazil, which could potentially lead to increased sales and growth for the company.
2. **India's impact on Walmart and Amazon**: India's government has imposed strict regulations on foreign e-commerce companies, including Walmart and Amazon, which could affect their operations and profitability.
3. **Cigna stock risk**: The US pharmacy-benefit manager Cigna is facing criticism from the Health and Human Services secretary Alex Azar, who is targeting pharmacy-benefit managers, making it a potential area of concern for investors.
4. **Global market trends**: The articles mention that world stocks are subdued, with some European markets struggling, while others, such as Hong Kong's Hang Seng and Japan's Nikkei, are holding steady. This could indicate a cautious tone in the global market.
5. **Netflix's price hike**: Netflix has raised its prices, which caused a stir among customers but was welcomed by investors. It is unclear if this will lead to another price hike in the future.

Overall, these articles suggest that there are various market and industry developments that could impact investor decisions, but no single clear opportunity or trend stands out.
