It appears that there are several news articles and investment-related pieces being shared in this format, but they do not form a cohesive story or narrative. However, I can summarize the main points of each article:

* Apple Music may be coming to Google Home devices, potentially following its release on Amazon Echo devices.
* Microsoft (MSFT) shares have climbed over 10% since the start of the year and are near their 52-week high due to the company's push into augmented reality. Some investors are wondering if now is the time to buy MSFT stock.

The other articles discuss:

* Short sellers' expectations for retail store wars
* JBG Smith Properties' plans for Amazon's HQ2 development in Arlington County
* Square Inc.'s (SQ) upcoming Q4 earnings report and potential revenue growth
* Walmart's expansion of its ad business and desire to become a major player in the online advertising market

Overall, it seems that these articles are focused on various financial and technological trends, with some overlap between them.
