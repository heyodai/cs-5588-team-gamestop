It appears that the provided text does not contain any information about a House resolution condemning hate. The text is primarily related to various business and technology topics, including smart speakers, digital transformation, retail closures, and online advertising.

However, I can provide you with some general information on how resolutions are typically introduced in the US Congress, particularly those related to hate or social justice issues.

In the US House of Representatives, a resolution condemning hate is usually introduced as a matter of public record, which allows for a formal expression of opinion or sentiment. This type of resolution can be used to express outrage or disapproval over a particular issue or event.

To introduce such a resolution, a member of Congress would typically follow these steps:

1. Draft the resolution: The member would draft the language and content of the resolution, taking into account their personal views and any relevant facts or information.
2. File the resolution with the Clerk of the House: Once drafted, the resolution is filed with the Clerk of the House, who is responsible for maintaining the official records of Congress.
3. Publish the resolution in the Congressional Record: The resolution would be published in the Congressional Record, which is a daily publication that contains official records of the legislative proceedings.

It's worth noting that resolutions are not laws and do not have the same binding effect as legislation passed by Congress. However, they can still serve as an important platform for members to express their views and engage with constituents on issues of public concern.
