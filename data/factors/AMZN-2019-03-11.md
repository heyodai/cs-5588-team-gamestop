The article discusses the struggles of Kroger, a grocery store chain, in its recent quarterly earnings report. The company's adjusted net operating income fell from $483 million to $391 million, and per-share operating income decreased from 54 cents to 48 cents. The decline was attributed to the heavy spending on digital initiatives and remodels as part of the "Restock Kroger" program.

The article also mentions that Walmart, a rival grocery store chain, has been gaining ground in terms of same-store sales growth, with a 4.2% increase. This has led some analysts to question whether Kroger's efforts will be enough to retain market share.

Despite the challenges, the article notes that Kroger's private label products now account for more than 30% of all goods sold, which drives higher-margin revenue. Additionally, Guggenheim analysts believe that the selloff in Kroger stock is overdone and that the company's post-earnings note implies a ~6x multiple on their 2019 EBITDA estimate.

The article concludes by stating that while Amazon.com's entry into the grocery market poses a challenge for Kroger, it's not a concern at this point. Walmart's expansion of curbside pickup and delivery services also raises questions about Kroger's competitive edge.

In terms of recommendations, the article does not provide specific stock picks or investment advice. However, it suggests that investors who have been able to take the emotion out of investing and focus on long-term growth may find Kroger's stock at a discounted price.

Overall, the article provides a balanced view of Kroger's challenges and opportunities in the grocery market, highlighting both the potential benefits of its "Restock Kroger" program and the competitive landscape that it faces.
