KeyBanc analysts have raised their price target on Amazon (AMZN) to $2,100, citing potential improvements in the company's retail margins, as well as the growing contributions of higher-margin AWS and advertising segments. They upgraded their rating on Amazon to "overweight" from "sector weight," and are now expecting a 25% gain from Thursday's close.
