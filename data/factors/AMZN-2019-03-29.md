The article discusses the recent acquisition by McDonald's Corporation (MCD) of Dynamic Yield, a company that provides point-of-purchase displays and other technologies to retailers. The author concludes that this deal will have little impact on the value of MCD stock, as it does not fundamentally change the company's business or prospects.

The author notes that while Dynamic Yield's innovations could potentially increase revenue for McDonald's, particularly through impulse purchases, the effect is likely to be marginal. Additionally, the author questions whether McDonald's has the necessary expertise and experience to oversee a tech company like Dynamic Yield effectively.

Overall, the article suggests that MCD stock is trading near its fair value and that investors should not expect a significant change in the stock's price as a result of this acquisition. The author notes that long-term holders of MCD who rely on dividend increases may see some benefit from the deal, but for other investors, it may not be enough to justify a purchase or sale.
