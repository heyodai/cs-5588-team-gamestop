The article discusses the potential of Disney's acquisition of Hulu to disrupt Netflix, a major player in the streaming industry. Here are some key points:

1. **Hulu's profitability**: Despite being owned by Disney, which has a majority stake (66%), Hulu is still bleeding money. However, with an estimated $2.7 billion in ad revenue expected for 2021, it may become profitable.
2. **Content strategy**: Unlike Netflix, which only uses its own content, Hulu and other streaming services can access a wealth of existing films and programs from third-party providers like Disney (via Fox) and NBCUniversal (via Comcast).
3. **Marketing and content creation**: If Hulu becomes profitable, it may adopt a more Netflix-like approach to penetration, with more marketing and content creation.
4. **No direct competition threat**: Despite the potential for Hulu to become a competitor to Netflix, its family-friendly content and separate brand will not harm Disney's main streaming service, Disney+.

Overall, the article suggests that Hulu's profitability and growth potential are worth watching, as they could provide insights into the success of Disney's streaming strategy.
