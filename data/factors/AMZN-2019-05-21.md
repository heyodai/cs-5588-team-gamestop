The article discusses Alibaba Group's (BABA) stock performance and its potential to benefit from the trade war between China and the US. The author notes that despite concerns about the impact of the trade war on Chinese consumers, many companies, including Starbucks, are still experiencing sales growth in China. Alibaba has been particularly successful in this area, with a recent report highlighting its ability to drive new Starbucks Rewards memberships through its online stores.

The article also touches on Alibaba's own business growth and prospects, noting that analysts expect the company to achieve sales of $54.5 billion during the 2020 fiscal year, and earnings of $6.56 per share. This has led to a current stock price of just 8.2 times sales and 26.7 times next year's earnings, making it a relatively undervalued stock.

Additionally, the article mentions Alibaba's increasing importance as a proxy for the global Chinese middle class, its expansion into cloud computing through a deal with Netflix (NFLX), and its focus on selling its own trade applications and pushing its payment network, Alipay, globally.

The author concludes that Alibaba is a good bet on the power of the cloud to change the world's economic geography, and that the company's brand is worth $131 billion, making it one of the most valuable brands in the world.

In terms of stock recommendations, the article does not provide specific picks, but rather highlights Alibaba as a potential investment opportunity. The author notes that they got off the Alibaba train in February with the stock at $167 per share and may be time to climb back on board despite recent volatility.
