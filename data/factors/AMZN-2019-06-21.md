The article discusses how network operators, such as Telefonica and Orange, are trying to stay relevant in the cloud computing industry by offering additional services that run on third-party clouds. This is a strategic move to position themselves for profit, especially with small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) being key targets.

To adapt to the increasing demand for cloud services from big tech companies like Amazon and Google, operators are focusing on providing comprehensive solutions through their extensive local teams. They're also trying to own the cybersecurity layer to control enterprise customers' cloud access, which would allow them to sell value-added services.

However, this approach is not without risks. Cloud providers already have robust cybersecurity solutions, making it challenging for carriers to convince customers that they can offer better services.

The article highlights how Amazon's Stadia game streaming service, which allows users to access games running on cloud servers via a cellphone or computer, could be a significant threat to the traditional network operator business model. If Stadia becomes widely adopted, carriers might find themselves struggling to compete with the convenience and performance of cloud-based gaming.

To mitigate this risk, carriers are exploring alternative strategies, such as offering edge computing services that bring data processing closer to customers' locations. This approach has the potential to turn the network operators into providers of "dumb pipes" â€“ simply allowing data to travel through their networks without adding much value.

The article concludes that while edge computing could be a Trojan horse for other cloud services, carriers face significant challenges in adapting to this new landscape.

Key points:

* Network operators are trying to stay relevant by offering additional services on third-party clouds.
* Operators focus on providing comprehensive solutions through their local teams and owning the cybersecurity layer to control enterprise customers' cloud access.
