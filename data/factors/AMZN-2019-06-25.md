It seems like there is no direct question or prompt to answer in the provided text. However, I can summarize some points related to Yandex's business and strategy:

* Yandex has expanded its offerings beyond internet search, generating 30% of its revenue outside of search.
* The company has been experimenting with creating its own social network and messenger, but without significant success.
* Yandex has found success with its personalized content feed, Yandex.Zen, which may generate over $100 million in revenue this year.
* Yandex is looking to take on traditional TV through the sale of a device called Module, similar to Google's Chromecast, which allows users to watch Yandex.Live streaming channel with content personalized for them.

If you'd like to ask a specific question or provide more context, I'd be happy to help!
