The article discusses Monzo, a fintech company that aims to challenge traditional lenders and offer alternative banking services. However, the author raises concerns about the company's viability and potential struggles in a competitive market. Here are some key points:

1. **Monzo's business model**: Monzo generates revenue primarily through fees and commissions, rather than lending or deposit-taking.
2. **Regulatory challenges**: The company faces regulatory hurdles, including new rules on overdraft charges and compliance requirements that push it to raise extra funds.
3. **Market competition**: Monzo will face stiff competition from established players like Lloyds Banking Group Plc, as well as newer entrants in the U.S. market.
4. **Tech giants' advantage**: The article notes that tech giants like Apple, Amazon, and Facebook have the scale, data, and engineering smarts to make significant incursions into the financial services market.
5. **Potential roadkill**: Monzo may struggle to compete with big banks and Big Tech firms, which could leave it vulnerable to disruption or even extinction.

The author concludes that while startups like Monzo have an edge in terms of institutional simplicity, they will likely face significant challenges in competing with established players. The article suggests that Monzo's success is uncertain and that the company may become "roadkill" or a victim of competition from bigger rivals.
