The article discusses how big tech companies, such as Amazon, Google, and Facebook, are increasingly disrupting smaller businesses they may have helped foster. While these giants created the current wave of startups by providing cloud computing services and enabling targeted advertising, their expansion into new markets is now putting pressure on smaller competitors.

Some examples of companies that are facing this challenge include:

* Lyft, which relies heavily on Google for advertising and uses Amazon's cloud to host its systems
* Fastly, a cloud computing company that benefits from distribution partnerships with Google and Amazon but faces competition directly from these giants
* Chewy, an online pet food and supplies site that uses Amazon's cloud but views the e-commerce giant as a rival due to its own pet products brand
* Pinterest, which was hit by changes in Google's search algorithms and policies that affected its traffic and user growth

The article highlights the power of tech giants to disrupt smaller businesses through their services. For example:

* Google made a tweak to its search algorithm in 2018 that hurt Pinterest's image pages from showing up in results
* Apple cracked down on code that allowed websites to collect data on users' browsing habits, which affected companies like Sciplay Corp., which develops mobile casino games

The dilemma for would-be trustbusters is how to rein in the power of these big tech companies without disrupting the web of companies that now rely on them.

Overall, the article suggests that while big tech companies helped create the current wave of startups, their expansion into new markets is now creating a challenging environment for smaller businesses.
