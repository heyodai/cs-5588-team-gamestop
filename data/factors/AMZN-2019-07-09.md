The article discusses the potential impact of a trade dispute between Japan and South Korea on the global semiconductor industry, particularly for companies like Samsung. Key points include:

*   South Korea is heavily dependent on Japan for 90% of its fluorinated polyimide and resists requirements, and 44% of its hydrogen fluoride needs.
*   The dispute could lead to a shortage of these materials, which are crucial for the production of advanced semiconductor chips.
*   Samsung's next-generation products, such as foldable displays and EUV-based foundry business, may be at risk due to the potential shortage.
*   Other companies, like Micron Technology Inc. and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co., may benefit from Samsung's struggles.
*   The situation is complicated by Japan's consideration of removing South Korea from its "White List" of countries treated as presenting no risk of weapons proliferation.
*   Industry analysts are uncertain about which companies will be most affected and how long it will take for alternative sources to be established.

These points highlight the potential risks and uncertainties facing the global semiconductor industry in the wake of this trade dispute.
