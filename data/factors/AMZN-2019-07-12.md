According to Bloomberg, Amazon's Echo speaker is losing ground in the market to rival smart speakers such as the Sonos One, Apple HomePod, and Google Home Max. The Echo still dominates with 63% of the US market share, but its sales are slowing down.

Amazon has attempted to improve the sound quality of the Echo with tweaks and the release of a standalone subwoofer and device that links the speakers to a stereo. However, it appears that these efforts have not been enough to regain ground lost to competitors.

In other news, Amazon is planning to start selling voice-controlled earbuds as early as this year, in an attempt to compete with Apple's AirPods. The company is also expected to release minor updates to the Echo range later this fall.

Additionally, Amazon has been working on a robot called "Vesta" that is designed to be a sort of mobile Alexa. The robot is still in development and not yet ready for mass production.

It's worth noting that Amazon has been trying to expand its Prime Day event to become a bigger deal than just an online shopping event. This year, Prime members will get access to exclusive deals and other perks during the 48-hour sale.

Overall, it seems like Amazon is facing increased competition in the smart speaker market, but it's still working on ways to improve its offerings and stay ahead of the curve.
