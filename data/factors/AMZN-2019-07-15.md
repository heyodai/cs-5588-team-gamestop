The article discusses the concept of mobility and innovation in economics, as presented by economist Philippe Aghion. Aghion argues that new inventions give people the chance to rise up the economic ladder faster, but also notes that companies come up with new processes and products to generate profits (or "rents"). He suggests that governments should not overly target these extra profits, as it would stifle innovation.

The article also highlights some challenges in promoting social mobility through government policies, such as higher taxes on wealth and income. Aghion mentions the example of France's tax reforms introduced by President Francois Hollande in 2012, which did not lead to significant improvements in social mobility.

Instead, the author suggests that tackling quasi-monopolistic practices of large companies may be a more effective way to encourage innovation and promote upward mobility. The article notes that European Union has fined Google three times for abusing its dominant position, and there are signs that U.S. antitrust authorities are finally waking up to this problem.

The article concludes by suggesting that robust competition enforcement is a better answer than higher taxation to promote social mobility and innovation.
