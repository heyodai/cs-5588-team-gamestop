Here's a summary of the article:

* IBM reported a 4.2% decline in second-quarter revenue to $19.2 billion, beating analyst estimates but still marking the fourth consecutive quarter of revenue declines for the company.
* The decline was attributed to the end of unprofitable businesses and cannibalization of legacy technology and data centers by new cloud-based services.
* IBM's Chief Financial Officer Jim Kavanaugh declined to comment on the impact of its recent $34 billion acquisition of Red Hat, with analysts eager for more information on how the deal will drive growth in cloud computing.
* The company has been trying to catch up with cloud market leaders Amazon and Microsoft, and is pinning its future on a hybrid cloud strategy that allows it to offer services on both private and public clouds.
* Analysts are skeptical about IBM's chances of success, with some describing the company as "small-fry" in the cloud market and noting that the recent deal with AT&T Inc. is not enough to move the needle.
* The company is expected to share more information on its integration strategy for Red Hat at an annual investor briefing on August 2.

Overall, the article suggests that IBM still has a way to go to regain its footing in the cloud market and turn around its stagnant revenue growth.
