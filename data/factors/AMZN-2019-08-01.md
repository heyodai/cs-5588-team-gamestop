The text discusses the financial performance of two companies, Spotify and Amazon. Here are the key points:

**Spotify**

* Spotify reported slightly slower subscriber growth than expected in its fiscal second quarter, with 108 million premium subscribers.
* The company missed on subscriber beats, but CEO Daniel Ek attributed the shortfall to execution issues and plans to make up for it by year-end.
* Spotify's shares fell as much as 6.1% before paring declines, closing down 0.2%.
* Investors have high expectations for Spotify, and the company's subscriber miss may not be forgiven.
* Despite competition from Apple, Amazon, and YouTube, Spotify's subscribers grew 31% year-over-year, about double the rate of Apple Music.

**Amazon**

* Amazon reported revenue that jumped 20% year-over-year to $63.4 billion, exceeding Wall Street expectations.
* The company's cloud computing business, AWS, continues to drive growth, with a 29% year-over-year increase in revenue.
* Amazon's e-commerce business saw a slowdown in sales growth, but still grew revenue by 14% year-over-year.

**Key Takeaways**

* Both companies reported strong financial performance, but Spotify's subscriber miss and Amazon's slower-than-expected e-commerce growth may be concerns for investors.
* Competition from other tech giants continues to be a challenge for both companies, but they are finding ways to adapt and innovate.
* Long-term profitability will depend on the success of Spotify's new royalty arrangements with major music labels and Amazon's ability to drive growth in its cloud computing business.
