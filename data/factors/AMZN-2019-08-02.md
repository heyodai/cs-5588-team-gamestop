According to a report by Bloomberg News, Apple has teams analyzing voice recordings made by Siri to improve its performance. The recordings are reviewed by contractors who listen to and transcribe the audio without knowing what was said, as part of an effort to eliminate gaps in Alexa's understanding of human speech. 

The Guardian reported that some Apple contractors have heard sensitive information, including sex, drug deals, and confidential medical information, while reviewing these recordings.  In response, Apple has suspended its Siri grading process globally and announced plans to allow users to opt out of participating in the review.

This comes as a similar issue is being investigated by regulators in Europe, where Google employees and contractors have been temporarily stopped from transcribing home assistant voice recordings due to concerns about sensitive information being contained within.
