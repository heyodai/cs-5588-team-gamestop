The article discusses FedEx's strategy of investing cash flow to fund real growth, similar to Amazon. Here are the main points:

1. **FedEx spends most of its cash on investments**: In 2018, FedEx spent $5.5 billion on capital expenditures, which is nearly all of its operating cash flow of $5.6 billion.
2. **FedEx is chasing Amazon's growth**: The company has been investing in various initiatives to keep up with Amazon's growth, such as drones, seven-day delivery, and partnerships with retailers like Walmart and Walgreens.
3. **Trade war a major risk**: The trade war between the US and China is a major threat to FedEx's future, as it can lead to a slowdown in global trade and impact its business.
4. **FedEx stock has been down 30% in the last year**: Despite this, the company's stock price has still attracted investors like hedge fund Pershing Square, which has reportedly been buying FDX shares.

Overall, the article suggests that FedEx's stock may be a good value at current levels, but investors should consider the risks associated with the trade war and its impact on FedEx's business.
