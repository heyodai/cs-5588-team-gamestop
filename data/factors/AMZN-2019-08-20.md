Apple is launching its video streaming service, Apple TV+, which will be available through the company's devices and third-party products such as Roku and Amazon Fire TV boxes. The service is expected to compete with Netflix and Amazon Prime Video for subscribers. Apple has reportedly spent around $300 million on two seasons of a drama series called "The Morning Show" starring Jennifer Aniston, Reese Witherspoon, and Steve Carell. The service is seen as a major threat to the dominance of Netflix in the streaming market.

Apple TV+ will be available through the company's devices, including Apple TVs, iPads, iPhones, and Macs, as well as third-party products such as Roku and Amazon Fire TV boxes. The service will also be accessible on Samsung televisions.

In the fiscal third quarter, services represented a record 21% of Apple's sales, while the iPhone continued to dip below 50% of the total. Analysts have suggested that Apple TV+ could top 100 million subscribers in the next half-decade, making it a major challenger to Netflix and Amazon.

The launch of Apple TV+ is seen as a significant move by Apple to expand its offerings beyond music and apps. The company has been investing heavily in original content, including films, television shows, and podcasts, and has been expanding its reach into new markets such as video streaming.

Apple's decision to enter the video streaming market is also seen as a response to the growing competition from Netflix and Amazon Prime Video. These two companies have dominated the streaming market for years, but are facing increasing competition from newer entrants such as Disney+ and HBO Max.

In an effort to compete with these new entrants, Apple has been investing heavily in original content, including films, television shows, and podcasts. The company has also been expanding its reach into new markets such as video streaming, and is seen as a major threat to the dominance of Netflix and Amazon Prime Video.

The launch of Apple TV+ is expected to be a significant move for the company, and analysts are watching closely to see how it will impact the company's financial performance. The service is expected to generate significant revenue for Apple, and could potentially become a major driver of growth for the company in the coming years.

Overall, the launch of Apple TV+ marks an important milestone for the company as it looks to expand its offerings beyond music and apps, and compete with the growing competition from Netflix and Amazon Prime Video.
