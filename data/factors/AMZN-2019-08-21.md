Amazon Opens Largest Campus Yet in India as E-commerce Dominance Seeks to Outgrow Walmart

Amazon.com Inc. has inaugurated its largest campus building globally in Hyderabad, India, marking a significant step in the company's ambitious expansion plans in the country. The 1.8 million square foot facility is Amazon's first owned building outside of the United States and will accommodate 15,000 workers.

The new campus is part of Amazon's strategy to dominate the Indian e-commerce market, which has been growing rapidly but remains largely untapped compared to other major retail markets like the US and China. The company has pledged $5.5 billion for its India operations and aims to tap into the country's large population and relatively low internet penetration.

Amazon's move is seen as a response to Walmart Inc.'s significant investment in the Indian market, which includes a $16 billion acquisition of Flipkart Online Services Pvt. Ltd., one of the country's largest e-commerce startups. The Indian government has also been promoting its digital economy through initiatives like the Digital India program.

"Amazon will invest heavily in new businesses and services that we think have huge growth potential," said Amit Agarwal, Amazon's country manager for India. "We are excited to build on the momentum of Prime membership in India, which has doubled over the past 18 months."

The largest buildings in Seattle house about 5,000 employees, but this campus will be much larger, with plenty of room to grow," said John Schoettler, vice president of Amazon's Global Real Estate and Facilities. The facility will build services globally, including AWS, Kindle, Alexa, Amazon.in, and Amazon Home Services.

Amazon is also exploring other opportunities in India, including a potential investment in Future Retail, one of the country's largest brick-and-mortar retailers. The company is also eyeing a food delivery business, with negotiations underway with multiple food companies.

The opening of this new campus marks an important milestone for Amazon's Indian operations and underscores its commitment to the country's growth potential.
