Based on the article, here is a summary of the outlook for Rite Aid stock:

* The company's typical customer is over 55 and earns under $40,000 per year, which may not be sufficient to support the business.
* Competition from online retailers like Amazon forces Rite Aid to sell at thin margins.
* Without a deeper partnership with Amazon or another major retailer, it is unlikely that Rite Aid can remain relevant in the changing retail landscape.
* The company's debts are too high, and numerous suitors have passed on what remains of Rite Aid.
* A possible scenario could be for Amazon to take over the stores entirely, allowing Rite Aid to play a significant role in the pharmacy business. However, this is unlikely.

Overall, the article suggests that Rite Aid stock may not be a viable investment opportunity due to its declining prospects and high debt levels.
