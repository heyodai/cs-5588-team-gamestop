It seems you've shared an article about Apple's plans to start online sales in India after the country eased rules that forced companies to source 30% of their production locally. The new rules now include exports as part of the requirement, which could provide a boost to Apple and help reduce its high dependency on China by building out an alternative supply chain in India.

Here are some key points from the article:

* Apple will start selling its devices online in India within months.
* The company has been lobbying against the original rule that forced companies to source 30% of their production locally, as most of its devices and components are manufactured in China.
* The new rules allow single brand retailers to set up online stores before physical shops, making it easier for Apple to expand its sales in India.
* Selling online will be a big step forward for Apple in a country where counterfeit products abound in online platforms, increasing buyers' distrust.
* Some of Apple's older devices are assembled by Taiwanese contractor Wistron Corp. in a factory in Bangalore, while the world's largest contract manufacturer, Foxconn Technology Group, tests assembly of Apple's latest iPhone X in a factory near Chennai.

The article suggests that Apple's move could help it control its own retailing and branding, both online and offline, and win greater customer loyalty in the Indian market. However, it also notes that the company's high prices and hefty import tariffs of up to 20% have put its products beyond the reach of average Indians.

Do you think this is a positive development for Apple and the Indian market, or do you have concerns about the company's pricing strategy?
