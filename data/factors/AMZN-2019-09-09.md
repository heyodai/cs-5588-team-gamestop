Apple has acknowledged that its supplier, Foxconn, was violating labor laws in a Chinese factory. The company released an annual report detailing working conditions in its supply chain, including the Zhengzhou facility where iPhones are assembled.According to China Labor Watch (CLW), Foxconn's factory is heavily reliant on temporary workers and teenage interns, which exceeds legal thresholds. The group found that some interns were allowed to work overtime or nights, and that dispatch workers did not receive benefits like full-time employees, such as paid sick leave or vacation time.In response to CLW's findings, Apple said it was looking into the report and had questions about the data. However, Apple and Foxconn are still allowing the use of dispatch workers despite violating the 10% standard.According to emails seen by Bloomberg, Apple met with Foxconn officials to discuss the issue, but no additional steps were taken. The company also claimed that most factory workers wanted to work overtime to make more money, as revealed in an anonymous diary written by a CLW investigator.
