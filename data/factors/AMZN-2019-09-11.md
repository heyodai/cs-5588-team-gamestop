The article discusses the use of facial recognition technology by law enforcement agencies, particularly in London and New York City. It highlights the limitations and potential risks of this technology, including:

1. **Inaccuracy**: 63.6% of computer-generated matches deemed credible by a human operator turned out to be incorrect.
2. **Dubious uses**: Police are using facial recognition in dubious ways, such as arresting people for petty crimes based on mistaken identities.
3. **Lack of oversight**: The technology is often used without proper oversight and limits, leading to potential "function creep" into unrelated areas, such as crowd control or analysis of people's emotions.

The article also explores the challenges of regulating facial recognition technology at the European Union level. While there is a clear definition of "sensitive" data like biometrics in the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), loopholes exist for national security and public interest reasons, leading to inconsistent application across EU countries.

To address these concerns, the author suggests that governments should consider proposals such as a ban or moratorium on facial recognition technology. This could help prevent misuse and ensure that the technology is used in a way that respects individual rights and freedoms.

The article concludes by noting that while the benefits of facial recognition technology are clear (e.g., identifying missing children, tracking terrorists), these benefits must be weighed against the potential risks and limitations. Ultimately, proper oversight and limits on its use are necessary to ensure that this powerful technology is used responsibly.
