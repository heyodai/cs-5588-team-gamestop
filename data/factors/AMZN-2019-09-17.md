Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) stock is aiming for a bump in its price following Apple's (NASDAQ:AAPL) annual hardware event, which saw a significant increase in the tech giant's market cap. Amazon shares hit an all-time high of over $2,000 in July but have since traded as low as $1,750, with current trading at $1,824.02.

The company is hosting its second annual product-focused press event on September 25, which is expected to focus on the Alexa voice interface. Improvements to sound quality and connectivity to more Amazon products are anticipated, potentially leading to customer upgrades and expanded reach throughout consumers' homes.

Amazon has been seeking hardware partners for Alexa in companies like Anker, Toshiba, JVC Kenwood, and Grundig, which could lead to improved support for Fire TV. Another possibility is an improved Kindle e-book reader, given Amazon's virtual monopoly on both e-books and readers.

However, Amazon faces challenges from government antitrust efforts concerning its Marketplace, as well as concerns over the treatment of delivery drivers. The company has expanded employment in various cities, including Boston, Chicago, Dallas, Nashville, Seattle, and Washington DC.

For investors, Amazon is available for 75 times last year's earnings and less than three times its expected 2019 revenue of $331 billion. Given its 30% annual growth rate and increasing profitability, the stock appears to be becoming cheaper by the day.

InvestorPlace recommends holding onto Amazon stock for the long run, ignoring short-term noise.
