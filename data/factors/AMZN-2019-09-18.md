The article discusses how Naren Prasad, a former engineer at Raytheon and current Alexa vice president at Amazon, has spent his career working on conversational AI technology. He grew up in diverse India and was fascinated by computers and humans communicating with each other from a young age. Prasad studied engineering and later worked in speech recognition at Raytheon before joining Amazon in 2013. At Amazon, he has been working on developing Alexa, the virtual assistant that can understand and respond to voice commands.

Prasad is proud of the progress they have made, noting that "it took me 20 years to get here." He mentions that Alexa will be able to respond in either Hindi or English without the user having to change settings. The AI will continue to learn and improve over time, and Prasad is confident that he has a fighting chance of coming up with new ideas in conversational AI.
