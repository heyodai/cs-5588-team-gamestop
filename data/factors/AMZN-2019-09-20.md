The Indonesian Palm Oil Association has reported that a prolonged drought and haze have set back the ripening of palm oil fruit, disrupting operations at plantations and mills. The association's chairman, Joko Supriyono, estimates that production growth this year will be around half of last year's rate, which was 13%. The dry weather has also affected older palm trees, reducing output.

Farmers in Sumatra and Borneo are using illegal slash-and-burn techniques to clear land for palm oil plantations, contributing to the haze. The Indonesian government has reported that only about 22% of forestry business permit holders have submitted mandatory reports on forest fire control, suggesting a lack of commitment in preventing fires.

The prolonged drought in Java has damaged more than 250,000 hectares of rice and caused over 580,000 tons of losses, according to the Agriculture Ministry. The government is urging farmers to plant seeds suitable for dry land for the small harvest in the fourth quarter.

Climate change demonstrations are taking place globally, with activists demanding action from governments and corporations. Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg is meeting with US President Donald Trump at the White House, while Apple's iPhone 11 is going on sale across the world.
