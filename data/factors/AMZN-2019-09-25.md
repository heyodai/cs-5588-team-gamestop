The article discusses Adam Gunningham, the former managing director who helped WeWork under Jeff Bezos at Amazon. Gunningham had previously worked with Gunningham at Amazon, where he was known for his management style and ability to deliver feedback in a calm and factual way. He was said to dress casually but with high-quality clothing.

Gunningham is now working as the CEO of WeWork alongside Minson, who will oversee finance, legal, human resources, real estate, and communications functions, among others. The co-CEOs have vowed to closely review all aspects of the company and anticipate "difficult decisions ahead."

Gunningham's management style at Amazon was described as formidable, where he would typically know more about each manager's business group than they did, and ask sharp questions at meetings. One notable example was when Gunningham asked Thomson if he had looked into using different types of search ads; Thomson hadn't.

Despite his personal wealth, Gunningham dressed casually with premium jeans, making him well-liked among employees. He also adopted leadership tactics from Jeff Bezos, such as asking for business proposals presented as written narratives and drilling into details.

The article concludes by noting that WeWork is preparing to go public again under the co-CEOs' leadership, with a focus on reviewing all aspects of the company and anticipating "difficult decisions ahead."
