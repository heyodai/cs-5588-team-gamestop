Here are some possible ways that lawmakers may focus on small businesses:

*   **Amazon's Treatment of Small Suppliers**: Lawmakers have already expressed concern over Amazon's decision to stop placing bulk orders with thousands of smaller suppliers. They may push for greater transparency and accountability from the company regarding its treatment of these suppliers.
*   **Algorithmic Changes on Google, Facebook, and Other Platforms**: Small businesses have complained about changes to search algorithm and news feed algorithms that can significantly impact their web traffic. Lawmakers may investigate whether these changes are unfair or biased against certain types of businesses.
*   **E-Commerce Regulation**: As online shopping continues to grow, lawmakers may consider introducing regulations to protect small businesses from larger companies. This could include laws around data collection, privacy, and anti-trust practices.

Lawmakers will likely continue to scrutinize Amazon's business practices and its impact on smaller suppliers and other businesses.
