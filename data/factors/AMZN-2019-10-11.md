The article discusses how Sarbanes-Oxley Act, which was enacted in 2002, has had unintended consequences on the IPO process and the public company landscape. The author, Jared Dillian, argues that the act's restrictions on corporate governance and financial reporting have driven companies to stay private longer, leading to higher valuations at the time of IPO.

The article highlights several issues with this current system:

1. **Lack of discipline**: Companies can continue to grow their valuations without facing scrutiny from investors or analysts.
2. **Excess and bizarre behavior**: Private companies may engage in reckless behavior, such as related-party transactions and conflicts of interest, knowing that they will be able to sell shares at high valuations before being held accountable.
3. **Rising wealth inequality**: The current system favors wealthy founders and early investors, who benefit from the growth of their companies without facing the same level of scrutiny or accountability as public company shareholders.

The author suggests that Sarbanes-Oxley should be repealed or modified to address these issues. They argue that the current system does not protect investors but instead fleeces them.

Some key statistics mentioned in the article include:

* In 2000, there were 306 IPOs in the US raising $53.5 billion.
* In 2019, there were only 190 IPOs in the US raising $40.2 billion.
* The number of publicly traded companies has shrunk from over 8,000 in 1996 to less than 4,000 currently.

Overall, the article highlights the need for reform and greater accountability in the public company landscape.
