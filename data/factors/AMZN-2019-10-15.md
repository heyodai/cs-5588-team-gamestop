The article discusses Amazon's Portal device, a smart display with a camera that allows for video calls. While the device has several features that make it appealing, such as being able to show recipes and other content on a screen, there are also concerns about privacy and security. For example, the wide-angle lens on the device can allow users to pan around another person's video frame without their permission, which could be invasive. Additionally, the article notes that Facebook has been criticized for its handling of user data, which may make it harder for Amazon to convince people to use the Portal. Overall, the article suggests that while the Portal has some great features, its privacy concerns and potential impact on user trust may make it a hard sell for some consumers.
