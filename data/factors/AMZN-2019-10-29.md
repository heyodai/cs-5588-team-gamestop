The article discusses the potential sale of the Daily Telegraph and its Sunday edition by the Barclay brothers to a strategic buyer such as Daily Mail and General Trust Plc. The valuation of the Telegraph is estimated to be around $665 million, which is significantly higher than its operating profit of $7.8 million last year.

The article questions how the Telegraph's valuation could justify such a high price, given its declining readership and structural decline in the media industry. It also notes that the only way for the owners to achieve their asking price would be to find a billionaire buyer who is looking for more than a typical vanity purchase, possibly with a specific agenda.

The article suggests that there are cheaper ways to influence British politics, such as investing in online news platforms or think tanks, rather than buying a struggling newspaper. It also notes that the valuation of the Telegraph is not justified by its current performance and that a buyer would need to be confident in the paper's turnaround plans.

Some key points from the article include:

* The Telegraph's operating profit has fallen significantly since 2004, when it was last valued at $32 million.
* The company's enterprise value is currently over 12 times its operating profit, which is a significant premium.
* A buyer would need to be confident in the paper's ability to return to profitability and increase its advertising revenue.
* The article suggests that the valuation of the Telegraph is more suitable for a billionaire buyer with specific goals, rather than a strategic buyer seeking to improve the newspaper's financial performance.

Overall, the article questions the logic behind the proposed sale price of the Daily Telegraph and highlights the challenges facing the media industry in the digital age.
