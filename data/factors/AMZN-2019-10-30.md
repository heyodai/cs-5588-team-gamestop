The article discusses the proposed merger between Just Eat and Takeaway.com, two companies in the food delivery industry. The deal has been met with skepticism from some investors, particularly those who have seen a significant surge in Takeaway's shares, which has led to concerns about a conflict of interest.

Prosus, the parent company of Delivery Hero, is making a bid for Just Eat, but some investors are questioning whether Prosus has a conflict of interest due to its relationship with Takeaway.com. Prosus has offered a 20% premium over the market value of Takeaway.com, which has led to concerns that it may be undervaluing the company.

The article also mentions that Delivery Hero is selling 3 million shares of Takeaway.com in the open market, which could lead to a decrease in demand for Just Eat's shares. This has caused some investors to cry foul, saying that Prosus is trying to unfairly influence the vote on the merger.

Just Eat's board has rejected the Prosus bid and recommended the merger with Takeaway.com, but shareholders are split. To approve the deal, at least 75% of Just Eat investors must vote in favor. Both companies have been criticized for offering low bids, and some investors have called for them to increase their offers.

The article highlights the challenges that both companies face in winning over big shareholders, particularly those who are concerned about conflicts of interest. It also notes that the U.K.'s Takeover Panel has not planned to take any action since Delivery Hero is properly disclosing its trades, and the U.K.'s Financial Conduct Authority has declined to comment on whether it has been asked to investigate the matter.

Overall, the article suggests that the deal faces significant challenges in winning over investors, particularly those who are concerned about conflicts of interest and the value of the companies' shares.
