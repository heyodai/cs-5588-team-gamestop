**Sidewalk Labs' Waterfront Toronto Project Gets a New Direction**

Waterfront Toronto has agreed to receive fair market value for the land when it's sold, with a current appraised value of around $590 million. The public agency will invest in affordable housing and sustainability projects.

The project also includes data storage and processing agreements with Sidewalk Labs, which has pledged to store personal information within Canada. Canadian companies will also be able to use patents generated by Sidewalk Labs' digital innovations.

In addition, the public will receive a revenue stream from products and services piloted in Waterfront Toronto-facilitated test-beds, based on global net revenues.

Sidewalk Labs has taken steps to engage more with local stakeholders this year, addressing concerns about transparency and community input. The project's outcome is uncertain but holds promise for the region.
