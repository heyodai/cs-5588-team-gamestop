The article discusses the rapid growth of digital payments in India, which has surpassed $1 trillion by 2023. The Unified Payments Interface (UPI) system, launched three-and-a-half years ago, now has over 100 million users and is expanding to 500 million users in the next three years. Amazon and Google are competing with local startup Paytm and other players in the digital payments market.

The article also mentions that global tech companies are racking up enormous losses as they battle for a slice of the Indian market, which is forecast to grow to $1 trillion by 2023 from about $200 billion early this year. The collective losses of SoftBank-backed Paytm, Walmart's PhonePe, and Amazon Pay alone totaled over $1 billion in the financial year ending March, a 167% spike from the previous year.

Facebook Inc.'s WhatsApp is also seeking final approval for its full-fledged countrywide launch of its payments service, which has been in a pilot phase with just 1 million users. Experts predict that the entry of WhatsApp into the arena will mark another inflection point because of an estimated user base of more than 400 million.

The article highlights the potential of the Indian market and the competition among players, including UPI's open architecture allowing digital wallet apps, payment banks, and startups to link freely to its platform. This allows for instant transfers of funds between bank accounts through a mobile device using a simple virtual handle, without sharing bank or personal details.

Key statistics mentioned in the article include:

* Over 100 million users for UPI
* Projected growth of digital payments market to $1 trillion by 2023
* Collective losses of SoftBank-backed Paytm, Walmart's PhonePe, and Amazon Pay totaling over $1 billion
* Estimated user base of WhatsApp Payments: more than 400 million

Overall, the article suggests that India's digital payments market is expected to continue growing rapidly, with a range of players competing for a share of this emerging market.
