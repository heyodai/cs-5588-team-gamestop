JPMorgan Chase & Co., the largest U.S. bank, is expanding its payments business to compete with tech companies like Uber and Amazon. The bank aims to offer e-wallets that simplify refund processes, expedite payouts to sellers, and boost loyalty for e-commerce companies. JPMorgan says it's targeting the 10 biggest e-commerce and gig economy companies, including Amazon, Uber Technologies Inc., Airbnb, and eBay Inc.

Here are some key points about JPMorgan's plans:

*   The bank wants to eliminate transaction costs associated with working with multiple providers.
*   It plans to go live with the technology with at least one client before the end of the year.
*   JPMorgan says its e-wallets use virtual account technology that can simplify an e-commerce company's refund process and expedite payouts to sellers.

Despite its efforts, JPMorgan may face competition from other financial institutions and tech companies. For example:

*   Uber is working with Green Dot Corp. to roll out e-wallets for drivers and riders.
*   PayPal bought Hyperwallet, a payout provider, in 2020 to boost its ability to handle cross-border payments.

While JPMorgan's plans may be ambitious, the challenge of competing with established players in the market will be significant. The bank will need to demonstrate the value of its technology and services to e-commerce companies and gig economy businesses.
