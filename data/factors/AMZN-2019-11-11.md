The article discusses two separate incidents related to vulnerabilities in ATMs:

1. **ATM hacking**: Researchers discovered two vulnerabilities in ATMs that could be exploited by hackers to steal card data and empty the ATM of cash. The first vulnerability targets the remote management system, allowing an attacker to access the data of anyone who uses the ATM without being noticed. The second vulnerability is in the software that powers the ATM's peripherals, such as its cash dispenser, card reader, or PIN keypad, which can be easily accessed and malicious commands injected into the system.
2. **Amazon's political gambit**: Amazon poured $1.5 million into a Super PAC run by the Seattle Metropolitan Chamber of Commerce to support pro-business candidates in the city council elections. However, voters rejected these candidates, keeping progressives firmly in control of the city council. This rejection revives chances for a tax on big businesses that Amazon helped fend off last year.

The article highlights the vulnerability of ATMs and the impact of corporate campaign spending on local politics, where voters have shown resistance to pro-business candidates backed by large corporations like Amazon.
