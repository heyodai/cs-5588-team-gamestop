The article discusses a potential legal challenge by Amazon against the US Department of Defense's decision to award a cloud computing contract, known as JEDI, to Microsoft. Here are some key points:

1. **Amazon wants to know how the Pentagon's technical staff evaluated the bids**: Frank Murray Jr., a procurement lawyer and partner at Foley & Lardner LLP, says that Amazon will likely seek documents and interviews with Pentagon staff to understand how they evaluated the bids.
2. **There may be differences between what lower-level technical staff and top Pentagon officials decided**: If there are discrepancies between the evaluations by technical staff and top Pentagon officials, it could be significant evidence for Amazon's case.
3. **Amazon could argue that the Pentagon erred in its evaluation process**: The company may claim that the Pentagon made errors in evaluating the bids on metrics such as security, price, and technical capabilities.
4. **The judge could force the Defense Department to reevaluate the proposals or open up the bidding process again**: If Amazon's legal challenge is successful, the judge may order the Defense Department to reassess the companies' proposals or reopen the bidding process.

Overall, the article suggests that Amazon will likely argue that the Pentagon made mistakes in its evaluation of the bids and seek to have them corrected.
