Amazon is teaming up with Chinese e-commerce platform Pinduoduo to offer a range of overseas products during the Black Friday online shopping event. The partnership will provide about 1,000 branded foreign products and run until the end of December. This move is part of Amazon's evolving China strategy, which includes opening pop-up stores on platforms like Tmall and JD.

The deal marks a significant shift for Pinduoduo, which has been working to shake off its reputation for hawking cheap products. The company's earnings for the third quarter were worse-than-expected, triggering its biggest share drop since its debut in July 2018. However, the partnership with Amazon may help recover some of the lost ground.

Pinduoduo's platform is known for social commerce, which encourages making purchases with others in return for generous discounts. The company has carved out a niche and has attracted half a billion active buyers. This partnership will tap into that large user base and provide access to high-quality foreign products.

Amazon's move comes as Alibaba logged a record $38 billion of purchases during its Singles Day promotion on Nov. 11, which has overtaken Black Friday to become the world's biggest shopping event. JD and PDD also launched similar campaigns around that date.

The partnership between Amazon and Pinduoduo is seen as a strategic move to expand Amazon's cross-border e-commerce business in China. It will provide an opportunity for Chinese consumers to access high-end products from abroad, which has been a key target area for the US retailer.

This development marks another example of how global tech companies are adapting to changing consumer behavior and market trends. As more retailers explore new sales channels, the online shopping landscape is likely to continue evolving in the coming months.
