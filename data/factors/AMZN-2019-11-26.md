The article discusses two projects aimed at reforming the web and promoting online security: Solid, a project by Tim Berners-Lee that aims to give users control over their personal data, and Brave, a browser developed by Brendan Eich that rewards users for viewing ads with blockchain-based tokens. Both projects have made limited progress in recent years.

The article highlights the challenges faced by both projects in achieving widespread adoption. Solid has struggled to gain traction, despite being released three years ago and having a start-up company to commercialize it. Brave has had more success, but its token system is still relatively new and lacks useful content that can be purchased with them.

The article suggests that the limited progress of these projects can be attributed to the reluctance of internet giants such as Google, Facebook, and Twitter to abandon their business models based on data monetization without user consent. The authors of Solid and Brave are seen as "David" figures facing off against "Goliath" companies that are resistant to change.

The article concludes that while both projects have potential, they will likely continue to face challenges in achieving widespread adoption until internet giants are willing to reform their business models.
