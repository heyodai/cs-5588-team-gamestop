This article discusses the impact of Black Friday on e-commerce and physical stores, particularly in relation to Amazon. Here are three key takeaways:

1. **Physical stores will remain vital**: While online shopping is expected to boom this holiday season, retailers recognize the importance of physical stores as a defensive strategy against Amazon. Investments in store renovations and new worker-scheduling systems are crucial to making stores enticing for customers.
2. **Online sales will dominate Black Friday**: According to a forecast from Adobe Digital Insights, $1 out of every 5 dollars spent between November and December will be online purchases. This year, 36% of e-commerce sales are expected to be made on smartphones, with a 20% increase from last year.
3. **Smartphone shopping is becoming increasingly popular**: The National Retail Federation expects over 165 million people to shop between Thanksgiving Day and Cyber Monday this year. As smartphones become more powerful and convenient, online shopping is becoming an attractive option for consumers, who can now make purchases on-the-go without needing to physically visit a store.

Overall, the article highlights the ongoing shift towards e-commerce and the importance of physical stores in competing with Amazon and other online retailers.
