The article reports on the recent success of Sea Ltd., a Singaporean gaming and e-commerce company founded by two entrepreneurs, Forrest Li and Gang Ye.

4. **Company's growth risks**: Sea has a "firm lead in the region that's tough to break," but faces concerns over its dependence on gaming revenue and the impact of e-commerce giants like Alibaba and Amazon entering the market.
5. **Shopee's growth**: Shopee, Sea's e-commerce platform, saw its revenue more than triple in the quarter, helping narrow net losses to $206 million.
