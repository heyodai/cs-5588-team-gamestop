The article discusses Amazon's latest effort to control its logistics costs by introducing a new storage and replenishment program. This program aims to declutter expensive facilities while having backup inventory close by, which can help merchants avoid losing sales when items run out or get stuck with big bills to stow products that aren't selling.

Amazon has been trying to expand its logistics capabilities to provide faster delivery times and increase customer satisfaction. The company has invested heavily in creating a network of independent service partners who start their own businesses and hire drivers dedicated to making Amazon deliveries. However, this effort has come at a cost, as the company's push for next-day delivery is costing more than expected.

The new storage experiment is seen as a way for Amazon to make the most of its existing facilities while continuing to invest in next-day delivery. The service prohibits shoes and apparel, perishables, and hazardous materials for now, but it could expand to other products in the future.

According to experts, this effort by Amazon shows that the company is trying to control the "middle mile" logistics stage, which connects factories and ports with stores and shoppers' homes. This is a critical stage of logistics where inventory needs to be stored closer to customers to achieve faster delivery times.

The article also mentions that Amazon's push for next-day delivery has tempered investors' expectations, but the company is still working towards its goal of making buying something online as fast and affordable as a quick trip to the store.
