The article discusses Google's $2.6 billion acquisition of data company Looker Data Sciences Inc., which is being investigated by the UK's Competition and Markets Authority (CMA). The CMA has issued an initial enforcement order, preventing companies from integrating their services while the regulator carries out a review of the deal.

This investigation comes as regulators in the US and EU are scrutinizing Google's data collection practices and business model. Margrethe Vestager, the European Union's Competition Commissioner, has called tech giants "robot vacuum cleaners" that are sucking up valuable data in a way that can undermine competition.

The article also mentions Amazon's own antitrust scrutiny on its cloud business, with the US government investigating whether Amazon is using its dominance to stifle competition. Additionally, it highlights Amazon's recent acquisition of smartwatch maker Fitbit Inc., which has raised concerns about what Google intends to do with the data that Fitbit users have shared over the years.

The article concludes by noting that regulators are increasingly scrutinizing tech giants' business practices and data collection methods, leading to a more crowded regulatory landscape.
