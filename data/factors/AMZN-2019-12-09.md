Here are the main points from the article:

* The UK's Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) is reviewing Amazon's bid to acquire a minority stake in food-delivery service Deliveroo.
* The CMA has frozen the deal due to concerns about the potential anticompetitive impact, particularly given Amazon's vast data resources and its presence in other markets.
* This is not an isolated incident, as the CMA has been increasing scrutiny of big tech companies' activities, including Google's acquisition of Looker Data Sciences Inc. for $2.6 billion.
* The CMA may be concerned that Amazon could use Deliveroo's user data to gain a competitive advantage in other areas, such as online groceries.
* The decision is a setback for Deliveroo, which has already raised $1.53 billion in investor funding and faces pressure to become profitable.
* For Amazon, the stakes are lower, but an adverse ruling would add another embarrassing exit to its UK food delivery venture.
