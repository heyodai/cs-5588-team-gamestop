The article discusses the takeover bid for Just Eat by two companies: Takeaway.com and Prosus (formerly known as Prosus Invest). Here are some key points:

1. **Takeover deadline**: The deadline for investors to tender their shares in Just Eat is December 11, which may increase pressure on Takeaway.com's offer.
2. **Investor expectations**: Investors expect a more generous bid from one of the companies, given the current valuation of Just Eat below its peers.
3. **Just Eat's problems**: The company faces competition from Uber's food delivery arm and Deliveroo, as well as challenges in building captive delivery networks to foster growth.
4. **Comparison with Deliveroo**: Despite being slower-growing, Just Eat has a more established brand and operating profit than Deliveroo, which is struggling financially.
5. **CEO appointment**: The departure of Peter Plumb as CEO has left Just Eat without a permanent head, potentially affecting its ability to navigate the takeover process.

The article concludes that Just Eat investors should expect a bigger sweetener from one of the bidders, and if neither emerges victorious by their deadlines, the Takeover Panel may intervene to create a formal auction.
