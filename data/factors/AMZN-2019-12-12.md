The article discusses the recent surge in earnings growth among S&P 500 companies over the past decade and how it may not be sustainable. The author suggests that the volatility of yearly changes in earnings per share is a major contributor to this growth, with an annualized standard deviation of nearly three times greater than that of stock prices. This volatility makes it unlikely that the recent record earnings growth will continue.

The article also notes that buybacks do not appear to have contributed significantly to this growth, and that the median earnings growth rate is actually lower than the average growth rate for the S&P 500 index. Furthermore, the dividend yield and price-to-earnings ratio are both expected to remain relatively stable in the coming years.

As a result, many Wall Street firms expect U.S. stocks to deliver more muted returns during the next decade. The author concludes that investors should not rely on past performance as a guide for future results and instead focus on understanding the underlying drivers of stock market returns.

Key points from the article include:

* Earnings growth over the past decade has been driven by more than just a handful of companies.
* The median earnings growth rate is 9.6%, which closely matches the S&P 500 index's average growth rate.
* Buybacks do not appear to have contributed significantly to this growth.
* Volatility in earnings per share is a major contributor to this growth, with an annualized standard deviation nearly three times greater than that of stock prices.
* The dividend yield and price-to-earnings ratio are both expected to remain relatively stable in the coming years.

Overall, the article suggests that investors should be cautious about relying on past performance as a guide for future returns and instead focus on understanding the underlying drivers of stock market growth.
