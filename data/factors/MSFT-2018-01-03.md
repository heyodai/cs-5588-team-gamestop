A design flaw has been found in Intel microprocessors, which affects kernel memory on Intel x86 processor chips manufactured over the past decade. This allows users to discern the layout or content of protected areas on the chips. As a result, shares of Intel have fallen by 2.6% and shares of AMD have risen by 6%. The fix for this issue will require updates to operating systems, which may cause the affected chips to operate more slowly.
