The issue at hand seems to be related to new League team skins being overpriced. The text doesn't explicitly mention League, but it does discuss various topics like Intel's data center customers exploring alternative microchips due to security flaws and Microsoft's concerns about patches slowing down PCs. However, none of these topics seem directly related to the price of League team skins.

If you'd like to discuss why certain products or services might be overpriced, I'm here to help with that as well!
