Based on the news articles provided, here are the top 5 factors that may affect the stock price of MSFT (Microsoft):

1. **Facial Recognition Bias**: The study finding that facial-recognition services from Microsoft and IBM are significantly more accurate for men than women and for whites than blacks adds to concerns about bias in artificial intelligence, which may impact MSFT's reputation and stock price.
2. **Tax Law Implications**: The passage of the new U.S. tax law allows tech giants to freely dip into their overseas cash reserves. While this may not directly affect MSFT's stock price, it could lead to increased investing and spending by the company, potentially benefiting its stock price in the long run.
3. **Cloud Storage Competition**: Microsoft's decision to give away cloud storage to lure users away from Box, Dropbox, and Google may impact its market share and revenue growth, affecting the stock price.
4. **Earnings Reports and Analyst Expectations**: The recent tech earnings round-up, including MSFT's latest earnings report, has set expectations for the company's future performance. Any deviation from these expectations could impact the stock price.
5. **Market Volatility and Trends**: The dramatic drop in the Dow Jones Industrial Average and the overall market volatility may lead to increased selling pressure on MSFT shares. However, if the company can demonstrate its resilience and continue to deliver strong results, it may benefit from the current market conditions.

These factors are subject to change and may interact with each other in complex ways, affecting the stock price of MSFT in unpredictable ways.
