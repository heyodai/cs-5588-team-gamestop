This article discusses several topics related to technology, law enforcement, and privacy. Here are some key points:

1. **Microsoft vs US Government**: The Supreme Court will hear a case about whether Microsoft must turn over customer data stored in Ireland to the US government. This case pits the interests of tech companies and privacy advocates against those of law enforcement.
2. **Tech Industry Takes on Trump Administration**: The tech industry is taking on the Trump administration at the US Supreme Court, arguing that the government should not be able to access personal data stored on overseas servers.
3. **European Union's New Legislation**: The European Union is preparing legislation to force companies to turn over customers' personal data when requested, even if it is stored on servers outside the bloc. This move puts Europe at loggerheads with tech giants and privacy campaigners.
4. **Surface Pro 4G LTE Review**: A review of the Surface Pro 4G LTE tablet, a variant of Microsoft's Surface Pro designed for enterprise partners. The reviewer notes that while it may be an awkward addition to the family, it has some powerful features.
5. **Global Data and Digital Borders**: The article highlights the growing issue of digital borders in an era where big companies operate "cloud" networks of giant data centers. This raises questions about how law enforcement can access electronic evidence stored on servers outside a country's jurisdiction.

Overall, these topics suggest that technology, law enforcement, and privacy are at odds with each other, particularly in the context of international data storage and transfer.
