Here are the top 5 factors that may affect the stock price of MSFT (Microsoft):

1. **India's growth trajectory**: Microsoft is expected to benefit from India's growing economy, which is predicted to reach a growth rate of 7.2% in the October-December 2017 quarter, driven by strong performance in manufacturing and services sectors.
2. **Settlement with IBM lawsuit**: The settlement allowing Lindsay-Rae McIntyre, Microsoft's new Chief Diversity Officer, to start her job in July may have an impact on MSFT's stock price, as it could be seen as a positive sign for the company's diversity and inclusion efforts.
3. **Artificial intelligence (AI) play**: Alibaba Group Holding Ltd is becoming increasingly focused on AI, which could potentially affect MSFT's stock price, given their recent investments in AI-related technologies.
4. **Government cloud services**: Microsoft is expanding its Azure cloud service to make it more appealing to local and federal agencies, which could lead to increased demand for the company's cloud-based solutions.
5. **Competition from Intel**: The increasing competition between MSFT and Intel in the enterprise business sector may affect MSFT's stock price, as investors consider whether Microsoft can maintain its market share and growth momentum.

Note that these factors are not exhaustive and may have varying degrees of impact on MSFT's stock price.
