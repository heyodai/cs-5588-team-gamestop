To make these articles better by starting to separate PvE (Player Versus Environment) and PvP (Player Versus Player) balance, I would suggest adding sections or subheadings that highlight the differences between PvE and PvP content, and how it affects game balance. Here's a possible way to restructure the articles:

**Magic Software Enterprises Ltd. (MGIC) Ex-Dividend Date Scheduled for March 12, 2018**

* **PvE Balance:** This article can focus on the technical aspects of the company's dividend payment, without discussing PvE or PvP balance.
* **PvP Balance:** As a side note, the author could mention how the company's financial performance might affect the overall gaming industry, including PvE and PvP games.

**Why Capital Spending in the Cloud Market Could Increase in 2018**

* **PvE Balance:** Discuss how capital spending in the cloud market affects PvE content creation, such as new server infrastructure or data center expansions.
* **PvP Balance:** Explore how increased investment in cloud technology might impact PvP balance, such as through improved latency or more robust matchmaking systems.

**How Exiting Ele.me Could Impact Baidu**

* **PvE Balance:** Focus on the technical aspects of Baidu's delivery business and its potential impact on PvE games that rely on delivery services.
* **PvP Balance:** As a side note, the author could discuss how changes in the food-delivery market might affect PvP content creators, such as through increased competition for players or more efficient logistics.

**How Did Fiscal 2Q18 Treat Microsoftâ€™s Margins?**

* **PvE Balance:** Discuss how Microsoft's fiscal performance affected PvE games that rely on its Azure cloud platform.
* **PvP Balance:** Explore how improved margins might impact PvP balance, such as through increased investment in esports infrastructure or more robust anti-cheat systems.

**Is Facebook Finally Ready to Challenge LinkedIn?**

* **PvE Balance:** Focus on the job search feature and how it impacts PvE games that rely on job boards or recruitment tools.
* **PvP Balance:** As a side note, the author could discuss how Facebook's expansion into the job search market might affect PvP balance, such as through increased competition for players or more efficient matchmaking systems.

By separating PvE and PvP content in these articles, you can provide a clearer picture of how changes in the gaming industry impact different types of gameplay experiences.
