Based on the provided news articles, here are the top 5 factors that may affect the stock price of MSFT (Microsoft):

1. **Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Cloud Computing**: Microsoft's investments in AI and cloud computing, particularly with its acquisition of GitHub and Azure, have been a key driver of growth for the company. The increasing demand for cloud services and AI solutions could continue to support Microsoft's stock price.
2. **Competition from Amazon Web Services (AWS)**: Amazon's aggressive expansion of AWS, including its recent $6 billion R&D spending increase, may pose a threat to Microsoft's cloud computing business. However, Microsoft's growing presence in the enterprise market and its efforts to acquire new customers could help mitigate this risk.
3. **Dividend Payments**: As mentioned in the article "Billionaire Ken Fisherâ€™s Favorite Dividend Stocks," Microsoft has been paying consistent dividends, which can attract income-seeking investors and provide a floor for the stock price.
4. **New Culture under Satya Nadella**: The adoption of a growth mindset culture under Satya Nadella's leadership has led to significant improvements in Microsoft's growth rate, from 4% to 12%. This cultural shift could continue to support the company's stock price and attract new investors.
5. **IoT (Internet of Things) Investment**: Microsoft's $5 billion investment in IoT research and innovation over the next four years may provide a tailwind for the company's stock price, particularly if the investments pay off with significant revenue growth.
