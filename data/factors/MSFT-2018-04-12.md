Based on the provided news, here are the top 5 factors that may affect the stock price of MSFT (Microsoft):

1. **Intel's involvement in the next Microsoft Xbox**: If Intel chips power the next-generation Xbox console, it could boost Microsoft's stock price due to increased demand for gaming consoles and associated hardware.
2. **Amazon's potential entry into the banking market**: Amazon's exploration of a checking account product could lead to increased competition with traditional banks, potentially benefiting Microsoft as a leading provider of cloud-based services.
3. **Google's dominance in the smart speaker market**: If Google surpasses Amazon in the global smart speaker market share, it could negatively impact Amazon's stock price, but positively affect Microsoft's as Alphabet is a major player in the market.
4. **Walmart's acquisition of Flipkart India**: The deal values Flipkart at around $20 billion, which could lead to increased competition in the Indian e-commerce market and potentially impact Microsoft's Azure cloud services business.
5. **Cyber-terrorism threats and Fortinet's growth**: As cyber-terrorism threats continue to grow, Fortinet's security products are likely to see increased demand, benefiting its high-end product categories and contributing to a stable growth trend for the company.
