Unfortunately, there is no news article about Microsoft (MSFT) stock price. However, I can extract some related information that may be relevant to MSFT's stock price:

1. Cloud computing: The article mentions that cloud computing is a wave that is breaking "at least for another decade, maybe two." This could potentially affect the demand for Microsoft's Azure cloud platform and its impact on MSFT's stock price.
2. Anti-piracy work in India: Microsoft is investigating KPMG's methods to crack down on software piracy in India, which may indicate a stronger stance against piracy and intellectual property protection, potentially benefiting MSFT's business.
3. Competition with Amazon Web Services (AWS) and Google Cloud: The article mentions that AWS is in the running for a large Department of Defense contract, while Google and Microsoft are underdogs. This could lead to increased competition for MSFT's Azure cloud platform, but also presents an opportunity for growth.

The top 5 factors that may affect the stock price of MSFT based on this news are:

1. Cloud computing trends and demand
2. Competition with Amazon Web Services (AWS) and Google Cloud
3. Microsoft's anti-piracy efforts in India
4. Growth opportunities in emerging markets, such as India
5. The potential impact of cloud-based technologies on the cybersecurity industry
