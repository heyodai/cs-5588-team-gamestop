Based on the provided news articles, here are the top 5 factors that may affect the stock price of MSFT (Microsoft):

1. **AI and Machine Learning**: Microsoft's recent acquisition of Semantic Machines to strengthen its AI capabilities and gain a competitive edge in the market. This move could positively impact the company's stock price as it indicates Microsoft's commitment to innovation in this area.

2. **Cloud Computing Expansion**: Amazon's expansion into Latin America, which could intensify competition with Google Cloud and Azure. As a leader in cloud computing, Microsoft may be affected by this development if it feels its own market share is being threatened.

3. **Security Flaws**: The discovery of new chip flaws (Speculative Store Bypass) that can allow passwords and sensitive data to be read. While the risk associated with these flaws is low, investors may be concerned about potential security risks for Microsoft's customers and products.

4. **Competition in the Cloud Market**: Amazon's expansion into Latin America could increase competition for Google Cloud and Azure in this region. As a major player in the cloud computing market, Microsoft may need to respond to this development by investing more in its own cloud services or improving its offerings.
