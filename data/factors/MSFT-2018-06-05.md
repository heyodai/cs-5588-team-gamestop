The New York Times reported that Facebook made agreements with at least 60 makers of phones and other devices that gave them access to the personal information of users' friends without their consent. The companies involved include Apple Inc., BlackBerry Ltd., Microsoft Corp., and Amazon.com Inc. These agreements allowed Facebook to expand its reach and offer device makers features such as messaging, "like" buttons, and address books.

This news is significant because it highlights Facebook's practices regarding user data and its relationships with third-party companies. The fact that these agreements were made without users' consent raises concerns about the company's handling of personal information.

The article also mentions that Microsoft acquired GitHub for $7.5 billion in stock, which is considered a significant deal in the tech industry. Additionally, there are reports on other market news and trends, such as the strength of the Nasdaq index and Facebook's struggles with data privacy concerns.
