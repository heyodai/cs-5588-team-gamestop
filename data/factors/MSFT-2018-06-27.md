Here are the top 5 factors that may affect the stock price of MSFT:

1. **Office 365 growth**: The strong demand for Office 365, driven by its compound annual rate of 4% growth in the last five quarters, is a key driver of Microsoft's overall business and has contributed to its stable growth.
2. **Debt levels**: The record $6.3 trillion in corporate debt, which has reached a new record, may trouble Wall Street investors facing a stricter rate environment, even as cash hoarding reaches a peak.
3. **Global tariff wars**: Mixed messages from the White House regarding potential global tariff wars have been on investors' minds, and this uncertainty may impact tech stocks like MSFT.
4. **Azure cloud adoption**: The growth of Azure cloud platform, which has created an opportunity for Microsoft to offer flexibility to clients with a public, private, and hybrid cloud structure, is driving ARPU (average revenue per user) growth.
5. **Microsoft's partnership with InMobi**: The collaboration between MSFT and InMobi will allow InMobi to leverage Azure's AI capabilities to create "A.I.-based segmentation" of consumers, which may have a positive impact on MSFT's stock price.
