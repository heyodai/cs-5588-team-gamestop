Here are the top 5 factors that may affect the stock price of MSFT:

1. **Cloud Computing Market Expansion**: Microsoft's acquisition spree in 2018, including the purchase of GitHub, is expected to expand its share of the cloud computing market and help it regain ground in the education technology market.
2. **Acquisition Deals and M&A Activity**: Microsoft's continued focus on acquiring new companies will likely impact its stock price. The company has made significant acquisitions recently, such as GitHub, and may continue to do so in the future.
3. **Growth of Azure and AWS Rivals**: Amazon Web Services (AWS) has been gaining traction in the cloud computing market, which could potentially affect Microsoft's share of this market. MSFT may see a decline in its stock price if AWS continues to grow rapidly.
4. **Expansion into New Markets: Movies and TV Apps for Mobiles**: Microsoft is working on developing movies and TV services for Android and iOS devices. If successful, this could lead to new revenue streams for the company and positively impact its stock price.
5. **Intellectual Property and Innovation**: As mentioned in the article, CNBC has added Boston Scientific to its IQ 100 index of market innovators, which indicates that MSFT's focus on intellectual property and innovation is paying off. This could lead to increased investor confidence and a positive impact on MSFT's stock price.

Please note that these factors are not exhaustive and may interact with each other in complex ways.
