Snowflake, a cloud-data startup, has partnered with Microsoft Azure, making its service available on the platform. The price for Snowflake on Microsoft Azure in the U.S. remains the same as it is through AWS.

This partnership comes after a key retailer played a role in Hot enterprise-focused start-up Snowflake deciding to bring its software to Microsoft's cloud.

Snowflake continues to offer its service atop Amazon Web Services, but now also makes it available on Microsoft Azure.
