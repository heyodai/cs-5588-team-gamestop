The article does not mention Amazon's plan to expand its presence in Cape Town specifically. It mentions that Amazon will be the sole tenant in a new office building in Cape Town, but it does not provide details about the number of jobs being advertised or the size of the project.

However, it is mentioned that Cape Town played a key role in the early development of Amazon's AWS cloud-computing business. This suggests that Amazon has a significant presence in the city and may be looking to further expand its operations there.
