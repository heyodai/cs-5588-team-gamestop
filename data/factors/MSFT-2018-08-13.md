Based on the provided news articles, here are the top 5 factors that may affect the stock price of MSFT (Microsoft):

1. **Dividend payments**: Microsoft is expected to pay a dividend, and the company's history of paying consistent dividends has been a positive factor for its stock price. The upcoming dividend payment may be a catalyst for investors, potentially driving up the stock price.
2. **Tax reform and corporate tax rate reduction**: The new tax reform law has reduced the corporate tax rate from 35% to 21%, which could benefit Microsoft and other companies in terms of increased profitability and cash flow. This change may lead to an increase in investor confidence, positively impacting MSFT's stock price.
3. **Cloud services growth**: IBM's Technology Services & Cloud Platforms segment, which contributes ~43% of the company's business, has seen double-digit growth driven by enterprises' growing demand for migrating their data to the cloud. Microsoft's Azure cloud platform is a competitor in this space, so any positive developments in this area could have a ripple effect on MSFT's stock price.
4. **Investor selling and CEO Satya Nadella's divestment**: Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella recently sold 328,000 shares, generating approximately $35.9 million. This sale may be seen as a sign of reduced investor confidence or changes in leadership, potentially leading to short-term market volatility and affecting MSFT's stock price.
5. **Market trends and ETF inflows**: The SPDR S&P 500 ETF SPY has experienced significant inflows, indicating increased interest in the broader US market. Microsoft is also one of the largest underlying components of SPY, so any positive trends in this ETF may positively impact MSFT's stock price.

These factors are not exhaustive, and other news articles or market events may have a greater impact on MSFT's stock price.
