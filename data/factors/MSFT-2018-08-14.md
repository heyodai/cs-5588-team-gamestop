Based on the text, it appears that there are various articles and discussions about Microsoft (MSFT) stock, but they don't provide specific recommendations or insights for individual investors.

However, I can summarize some of the key points from these articles:

1. **Semiconductor industry growth**: The semiconductor industry is a driving factor behind the growth of the "Computer and Technology" sector. Companies like Mellanox (MLNX) and Vishay (VIA) are mentioned as examples.
2. **Dividend hikes**: Some companies, including Microsoft (MSFT), are expected to increase their dividend payments before the end of 2018.
3. **Microsoft's resurgence**: After a decade in the wilderness following the dot-com bust, Microsoft has regained its footing under new leadership and through strategic acquisitions like LinkedIn and GitHub.
4. **Cloud business growth**: Microsoft is rapidly growing its cloud revenue, which could pose a challenge to Amazon (AMZN) investors who rely on the company's e-commerce operations for profits.
5. **Bitcoin narrative**: The article mentions that bitcoin's value will come in time, even if investors are spooked now, according to cryptocurrency investing strategist Meltem Demirors.

Without more specific information or analysis, it's difficult to provide personalized investment advice. However, I can offer some general suggestions:

* Consider diversifying your portfolio by investing in a mix of established companies like Microsoft (MSFT) and growth-oriented stocks.
* Keep an eye on the semiconductor industry, as it has been a key driver of the "Computer and Technology" sector's growth.
* Monitor dividend-paying stocks, including Microsoft (MSFT), to see if they increase their payout before the end of 2018.
* Be cautious when investing in cloud-based companies like Amazon (AMZN) and Microsoft (MSFT), as these businesses can be highly competitive and subject to fluctuations in demand.

Please consult with a financial advisor or conduct your own research before making any investment decisions.
