There is no text about SAP SE (SAP) specifically. However, I can summarize some general information about SAP and provide some context for the stock charts mentioned:

**SAP SE (SAP)**: SAP is a German multinational software company that develops enterprise resource planning (ERP), customer relationship management (CRM), and supply chain management (SCM) software. The company is scheduled to report its third-quarter 2018 results on October 18.

**Stock Charts**: The article mentions three big stock charts for Monday, which include:

1. Wells Fargo
2. L Brands
3. Charles Schwab

These stocks are not mentioned in the context of SAP SE (SAP).
