There is no specific topic or question being asked in this text, it appears to be a collection of news articles and stock market updates from various sources such as Zacks.com, Bloomberg, and Yahoo Finance. There are some quotes and summaries of financial analyst opinions and technical analysis, but there is no single point or topic that can be distilled into a concise answer.

However, I can try to summarize the main points of the articles:

* Microsoft (MSFT) stock was trading mixed on Monday after the company's Q1 2019 earnings call.
* Technology stocks were mixed in early Monday trading, with some names like Apple (AAPL), IBM, and Cisco Systems (CSCO) seeing significant price movements.
* Symantec (SYMC) stock rose 8% in extended trading after the company reported better-than-expected Q2 results.
* Fund managers are girding for more volatility in the market ahead, with some trimming their stocks as a result of record early voting in US midterm elections.

If you have any specific questions or topics related to these articles, I can try to help.
