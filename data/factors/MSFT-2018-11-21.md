The article discusses the current state of the tech sector and some specific stocks that are making headlines. Here's a summary:

* Microsoft stock has declined by 13% from early October highs, but still remains up 20% for the year. This decline is attributed to raised expectations for fiscal 2019, which led to investors pricing in potentially too much growth.

* Microsoft's enterprise-oriented business is being rewarded by investors as a source of stability, while consumer-focused companies like Apple and Amazon have been hit harder due to concerns about slowing revenue growth.
* AMD has made gains this year due in part to issues at Intel and NVIDIA that helped it gain market share in the server CPU and GPU markets.
* Technology stocks were trending higher pre-market on Wednesday, with some of the top stocks including Microsoft, Apple, IBM, Cisco, and Alphabet (Google).
* Google is planning to expand its data center presence in Denmark, which will help minimize costs.
* Diane Greene's tenure as head of Google Cloud was marked by internal clashes and missed acquisitions, but her successor Thomas Kurian brings experience from Oracle.
* The FTSE 100 index bounced back on Wednesday with the help of oil and bank stocks, while Kingfisher acted as a drag due to poorly received results.
