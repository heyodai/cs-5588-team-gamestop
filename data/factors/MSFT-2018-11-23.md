Based on the provided news articles, here are the top 5 factors that may affect the stock price of MSFT (Microsoft):

1. **Tech worries and concerns about software regulation**: The article mentions "tech worries" as a reason for massive losses in tech and Internet-related shares. This suggests that investors may be concerned about potential regulatory challenges facing Microsoft's industry, which could impact its stock price.
2. **Competition from social media platforms**: President Trump's comments on regulating social media companies, including Twitter, Facebook, and Google, may have implications for Microsoft's Azure platform or other cloud-based services. If the focus shifts to regulating tech giants' online presence, it could affect MSFT's stock price.
3. **Investigations by Big Four accounting firms**: The article highlights that the Big Four accounting firms are investigating their clients' software use on behalf of software companies like Microsoft and SAP. This raises concerns about conflicts of interest and potential scrutiny of Microsoft's business practices, which could impact its stock price.
4. **Global market uncertainty**: The Dow Jones Futures article mentions that stock futures fell heading into Friday's half-day post-Thanksgiving session, indicating a general sense of unease in the market. Global economic uncertainty, including concerns about trade policies and technology regulation, may affect MSFT's stock price.
5. **Industry-specific factors (e.g., energy shares)**: The article mentions that weakness in energy shares contributed to reversals over the first two trading days of the week, indicating a broader impact on tech stocks like MSFT. A decline in energy-related industries could have spillover effects on Microsoft's stock price, which is heavily invested in cloud computing and other technology sectors.

Note that these factors are not necessarily directly related to MSFT's specific business or financial performance but rather contribute to the overall market sentiment and uncertainty that may impact its stock price.
