Based on the news articles provided, the top 5 factors that may affect the stock price of MSFT (Microsoft) are:

1. **Oversold market conditions**: The market has gotten too oversold in December, which could lead to a short-term rally, potentially benefiting MSFT's stock price.
2. **Acquisitions and partnerships**: MSFT has been involved in several notable acquisitions and partnerships, such as its partnership with Facebook for Workplace and its cooperation agreement with Haimo Technologies Group (China). These deals can drive growth and increase investor confidence, positively affecting the stock price.
3. **Growth of cloud services**: MSFT's cloud business has been growing steadily, with Google's hardware revenues expected to grow from 6% to 8% of the company's gross revenues in 2021. This growth trend could continue to drive up demand for MSFT's cloud services and increase investor confidence.
4. **Competition in the smart speaker market**: MSFT's voice assistant Siri has improved its performance, which could potentially threaten AMZN (Amazon) and GOOGL (Alphabet) in the smart speaker market. A strong presence in this market could drive growth for MSFT and negatively impact its competitors.
5. **Market sentiment and investor expectations**: The battered stock market is poised for a powerful short-term rally, which could benefit MSFT's stock price as investors become more optimistic about the overall market outlook. Positive sentiment and high investor expectations can drive up demand for stocks like MSFT, leading to increased stock prices.
