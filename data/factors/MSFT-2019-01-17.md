There is no article to summarize. The text appears to be a collection of news articles and press releases from various sources, including Moovly, Microsoft, The New York Times, Reuters, and Walgreens Boots Alliance. There is no specific article or topic to summarize.

However, I can provide some information on the topics mentioned:

* Moovly has integrated its video creation platform with Microsoft OneDrive, allowing users to access and use multimedia files more easily.
* Microsoft has pledged $500 million to support affordable housing in the Seattle area, including construction loans for low- and middle-income workers.
* Walgreens Boots Alliance has signed a seven-year deal with Microsoft to develop new healthcare delivery models, with Microsoft becoming the strategic cloud provider of Walgreens.
