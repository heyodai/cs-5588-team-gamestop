The article discusses Sonos' potential entry into the premium headphone market and its competition with Apple. The global market for headphones and earphones is expected to reach $20 billion by 2023, making it a significant revenue stream. However, Sonos will face stiff competition from existing manufacturers and Apple, which has IP, experience with AirPods launch, and formidable marketing muscle on its side.

The key advantage Sonos has over Apple in this market is support for multiple music services and digital assistants. This could be a competitive differentiator for Sonos, but it remains to be seen whether it will be enough to overcome the barriers posed by Apple's strong brand and marketing presence.

Sonos' investors are likely watching this battle closely, as the company's annual revenue was around $1.1 billion in 2018. If Sonos can successfully enter and establish a presence in the premium headphone market, it could be a significant win for the company and its shareholders.
