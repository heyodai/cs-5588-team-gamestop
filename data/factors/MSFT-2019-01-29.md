The article discusses three reasons to consider buying Amazon stock now:

1. **Impressive Growth Numbers**: Amazon's earnings per share are expected to grow 335% and revenue is expected to grow 30.6%, which represents a year-over-year deceleration in growth but still impressive numbers.
2. **Vast Moat**: Amazon's Prime membership, Whole Foods acquisition, online business, advertising business, and cloud-computing business offer a strong foundation for long-term growth and a competitive advantage in various markets.
3. **Technical Analysis**: The stock chart is consolidating nicely above the 21-day and 50-day moving averages, with support near $1,450, making it an attractive entry point.

Additionally, the article mentions that Amazon's valuations are not necessarily cheap on an earnings basis, but its ten-year return of 3,160% shows that it hasn't hindered its performance.

It's worth noting that the author, Bret Kenwell, is a long-term investor and has taken a small position in AMZN stock, which he plans to add to further if the stock declines.
