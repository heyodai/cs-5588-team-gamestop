The article discusses the outlook for Turtle Beach Corporation (HEAR), a company that specializes in gaming headsets and accessories. Here are some key points from the article:

* HEAR's stock has been on the rise due to renewed interest in esports, with an estimated 43 million viewers watching the League of Legends championship last year.
* Analysts expect HEAR's earnings to improve significantly, with a projected $2.60 per share for 2018 and a forward PE ratio of 10x.
* However, profit forecasts for 2019 are lower, at $1.65 per share, which may raise concerns about the sustainability of growth.
* The company faces competition from larger gaming equipment manufacturers like Sony and Microsoft, which could erode its market share.
* To maintain its competitive edge, HEAR needs to innovate and expand its "moat" (its unique selling proposition).
* The article also mentions that companies like Roku have thrived by maintaining a neutral reputation in their respective markets.
* Despite the potential for growth, the company's small size and lack of differentiators make it a speculative play at best.
