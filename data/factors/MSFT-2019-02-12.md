Starbucks is a strong and stable company with a solid track record of growth and profitability. Its long-term strategy of technology, geographic expansion, and large Roastery stores seems to be working well. CEO Kevin Johnson has moved the company in a positive direction, and the addition of four women to its board is a significant step towards diversity.

The company's stock price should not be doing as well as it is given the growing competition in the coffee industry. However, Starbucks has changed America and remains a leader in the market.

Investors may consider buying Starbucks stock for long-term gains, but it's essential to note that the dividend is fully backed by profits and pays 2.1%. The current price of $69.14 represents nearly 31 times trailing earnings, making it a relatively expensive stock.

Some investors may be criticized for betting on Schultz' leadership, but owning Starbucks stock is not stupid. Dana Blankenhorn, a financial and technology journalist, owns shares in MSFT and recommends buying Starbucks for long-term gains.

Microsoft (MSFT) is another company worth considering as a potential million-dollar maker stock. Founded in 1975, Microsoft has come a long way since its early days. If invested around the time of its IPO, $10,000 would be worth approximately $160,000 today. With its strong brand and diverse product portfolio, Microsoft seems like a good investment for the long haul.

In conclusion, both Starbucks and Microsoft have solid tracks records and potential for long-term growth. However, it's essential to consider the current market conditions and prices before making any investment decisions.
