Here is a summary of the article:

Microsoft (MSFT) saw its Intelligent Cloud segment jump by 20% to $9.4 billion in Q4, driven by server products and Azure growth. The company has also benefited from the retooling of its Office Suite and acquisitions like LinkedIn and Github. MSFT's CFO Amy Hood stated that the company is winning more long-term cloud deals.

The article suggests that Microsoft's premium valuation (22X forward P/E multiple) is well-deserved, particularly given the company's strength in the fast-growing cloud market. Additionally, a potential deal with VMware could further boost the company's stock price.

However, some analysts are keeping an eye on whether MSFT can reach $1 trillion in value this year, similar to Apple and Amazon. The article mentions that while neither of those companies has remained above the trillion-dollar valuation, MSFT is still a strong contender.
