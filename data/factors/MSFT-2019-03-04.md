The article discusses the stock market situation surrounding VMware (NASDAQ: VMW), which was spun off from EMC in 2017 and is now owned by Dell Technologies. The author argues that owning VMware shares is a better investment than holding Dell shares, despite both being tied to Dell's financial health.

Key points:

* VMware has made significant progress in the cloud computing space, with its virtualization niche being increasingly threatened by the rise of cloud computing.
* Despite this, VMware continues to grow at an annual rate of 14%, driven by its virtualization and cloud container solutions.
* The company recently announced a partnership with Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) that will end the virtualization war between the two companies.
* As a result, VMware is now sitting in the "hybrid cloud" space, where companies have both their own clouds and contracts with public cloud vendors.

Reasons to buy VMware:

* The company's virtualization niche is being increasingly threatened by the rise of cloud computing, making its current offerings more valuable.
* The partnership with Microsoft will end the virtualization war, cementing VMware's position in the hybrid cloud space.
* VMware has a strong track record of growth and innovation.

Reasons to buy Dell:

* Dell shares are up 14% over the past month, driven by the company's expected return to profitability.
* The deal that took Dell private in 2016 gave the company control of 80% of VMware common stock.
* However, this also means that investors face a buyer's dilemma: if interest rates rise, making it difficult for Dell to pay down debt, then owning VMware shares may be more attractive.

Conclusion:

The author recommends buying VMware shares over Dell shares, despite the latter offering a similar ownership stake in the company. The author argues that VMware has a strong track record of growth and innovation, and is well-positioned to benefit from the rise of hybrid cloud computing.
