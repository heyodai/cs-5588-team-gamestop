Based on the provided text, here are three major advantages that make PayPal stock a solid buy:

1. **Venmo's growth**: Venmo has been a huge winner for PayPal, with total payment volume soaring by 80% to $19 billion in the latest quarter. This growth is expected to continue, with PYPL forecasting TPV to hit $100 billion this year.
2. **Payments operating system**: PayPal has created an operating system for mobile and digital commerce by partnering with financial institutions, which can be extremely valuable. The company has a massive user base (267 million active accounts) and necessary core technologies for payments, making it difficult for others to replicate.
3. **Market opportunity**: The digital payments market is vast, with estimates suggesting it's a staggering $100 trillion. PayPal has only a small share of this market, leaving significant runway for growth.

These advantages suggest that PayPal stock may be a solid buy despite its relatively high price-to-earnings ratio (56X).
