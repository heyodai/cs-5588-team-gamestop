Google's vision for the future of gaming is streaming. The company plans to launch its game streaming service, Project Stream, which will allow users to play high-quality games on various devices without the need for a dedicated game console.

**Key Details:**

1. **Project Stream**: Google has already completed a public trial of Project Stream, which allowed users to play Assassin's Creed Odyssey using only a Chrome browser.
2. **Project Yeti**: This is an ambitious project that aims to revolutionize gaming by hosting games on cloud servers and streaming them in real-time to devices over the internet.
3. **Hardware**: Google has patented a wireless game controller, and rumors suggest that they are working on new hardware, including a device that can stream games to TVs.
4. **Microsoft's xCloud**: Microsoft is also exploring game streaming services, which may compete with Project Stream.

**Upcoming Event:**

On March 19, Google plans to provide an update on its gaming efforts, including Project Stream and Project Yeti. This event has the potential to reveal more about the company's vision for the future of gaming.

**Investment Implications:**

If Google succeeds in launching a successful game streaming service, it could have significant implications for the gaming industry and investors. The global video game industry is worth an estimated $138 billion, and positioning itself to grab a chunk of that has upside potential for Google.

**Key Takeaway:**

Google's Project Stream and Project Yeti are part of a larger effort to revolutionize gaming by streaming high-quality games over the internet. While Microsoft's xCloud service may be a competitor, Google's vision for the future of gaming is centered around cloud-based services that offer more choice and versatility for gamers.
