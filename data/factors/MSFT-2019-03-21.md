The article discusses Microsoft's (MSFT) stock performance and provides insights on whether it's a good buy or hold. Here are some key points:

1. **Microsoft's strong balance sheet**: The company has a massive cash hoard, growing dividend, and solid balance sheet, which makes it a attractive investment.
2. **Fair valuation**: With a forward PE ratio of almost 24, Microsoft's stock is fairly valued compared to the overall market.
3. **Buy case weakened**: The recent price increase has made the buy case for MSFT weaker, but its cloud dominance and strong balance sheet still make it a solid hold.
4. **Dividend growth**: Microsoft has been growing its dividend consistently for 15 years, which is a strong indication of its commitment to shareholder value.
5. **Hold case strengthened**: The company's solid balance sheet and dividend growth make the hold case stronger than ever.

The article concludes that while it's not the best time to buy MSFT, investors who already own the stock or are considering adding to their positions should hold on. It's also worth noting that Sony (SNE) stock has nothing to fear from Alphabet's Stadia, as PlayStation remains a viable investment opportunity.
