The article discusses how Walmart is trying to compete with Amazon by chasing its growth and revenue, but it's not a sustainable strategy. The author argues that Walmart should focus on delivering store brands with high quality and low prices through control of the supply chain, squeezing out costs, and handing gains back to investors as dividends rather than buying back stock in hopes of creating capital gains.

The article highlights several reasons why chasing Amazon is not a good idea:

1. Walmart's growth rate has slowed down compared to Amazon's.
2. Walmart's focus on ecommerce sales is not enough to drive long-term growth.
3. Walmart's efforts to build its own gaming service and streaming platform are unlikely to succeed.
4. Walmart's dividend yield of 52 cents per share is safe based on operating cash flow, but not based on net income.

Instead, the author suggests that Walmart should focus on building store brands with high quality and low prices through control of the supply chain, squeezing out costs, and handing gains back to investors as dividends. This approach would be more in line with what a mature company like Walmart should be doing.

The article also mentions other companies that are worth looking at, such as Costco Wholesale, which has been beating Sams Club for years.

Overall, the article concludes that chasing Amazon is not a good strategy for Walmart and that the company should focus on building sustainable growth through its core business.
