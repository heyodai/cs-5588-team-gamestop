The article discusses various topics related to Microsoft and cloud computing, including:

1. **Sexual harassment and discrimination**: A federal judge refused to certify a class-action lawsuit brought by three women working at Microsoft, citing that it would be unfair to lump together thousands of women at the company due to their failure to identify Microsoft policies leading to unequal pay.
2. **Cloud computing trade deal**: The US and China are in talks to add a concession related to cloud computing as part of a trade deal. Chinese officials met with representatives from companies like Microsoft, Apple, and Amazon to discuss the proposal in detail.
3. **Microsoft's AI research collaboration**: Microsoft has worked on artificial intelligence research with a Chinese military-run university, which could be used for surveillance and censorship. This has sparked anger among China hawks on Capitol Hill.
4. **Space junk cleanup**: A supermassive black hole could potentially suck up space junk, but it would also swallow our solar system. A more practical idea comes from Japan's Astroscale, which plans to announce further funding this week ahead of its first mission in 2020.

The article concludes that if Satya Nadella, Microsoft's CEO, fails to address the issues of sexual harassment and discrimination, it could harm the company's stock price over the next 12-24 months. The author has considered Microsoft a must-own tech stock due to its focus on cloud computing, but notes that the company needs to earn its pay by addressing these concerns.
