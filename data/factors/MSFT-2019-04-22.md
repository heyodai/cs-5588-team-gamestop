The article discusses the performance of Cisco Systems (CSCO) stock and its valuation, as well as the potential for growth in future years. The author notes that while CSCO has had a impressive run, its recent success may not be sustainable at high valuations.

In contrast to Microsoft (MSFT), which has undergone significant changes in its business model to achieve growth, Cisco's legacy business remains flat, and security is still only 6% of revenue. This raises concerns about the sustainability of CSCO's current valuation, with a price-to-earnings multiple of over 18x FY19 consensus EPS.

However, the author notes that strong Q3 earnings could lead to increased analyst targets and price forecasts, which would increase the stock's upside potential. Additionally, the advent of 5G technology may contribute to Cisco's growth in future years.

The article also highlights three dividend stocks that are expected to pay dividends for many years to come, positioning themselves as "next generation" Dividend Aristocrats.

In terms of recommendations, the author notes that investors should be cautious when sticking with CSCO at current valuations, as it may not be sustainable. However, they do note that strong Q3 earnings could lead to increased upside potential.

Overall, the article presents a nuanced view on Cisco's stock performance and highlights the importance of considering valuation and growth prospects in investment decisions.
