The article discusses Microsoft's stock performance and valuation. Here are some key points:

1. **Microsoft's strong earnings report**: The company reported 14% revenue growth, which is a good sign for the future.
2. **Valuation concerns**: Despite the strong earnings, Microsoft's stock price has risen significantly, leading to concerns about its valuation. The company trades at around 8x Price/Sales, which is relatively high compared to other tech companies.
3. **Pricing target**: Based on the assumption of another year of 14% revenue growth, the author estimates a 12-month price target of around $115/share.
4. **Earnings multiples**: Microsoft's earnings multiples are relatively high at 29x trailing and 26x forward, which suggests that the stock may be due for a correction if growth slows down.
5. **Comparison to Alphabet (GOOGL)**: The article mentions that Alphabet, another large tech company, saw its stock price drop by 10% after reporting soft earnings results, highlighting the risks of overvaluation.

Overall, the author suggests that Microsoft's stock has become too hot and may be due for a correction, especially if growth slows down or if other tech companies report weak earnings. The recommended 12-month price target of $115/share is relatively conservative compared to the current market price.
