Without strong guidance from Nvidia management, NVDA stock could drop toward $100. The company's Q4 earnings report is scheduled for Thursday, and investors are looking for clues about the outlook for the second half of FY2020 and beyond.

The bull case is that first-half weakness is just a blip caused by the cryptocurrency bubble and a temporary slowdown in data-center spending. However, the bear case is that Nvidia is dealing with standard cyclicality in the semiconductor business, which could lead to a long-term decline in growth.

Investors should be cautious about NVDA stock, as it has gained 30% so far this year and pricing in a reasonable probability of recovery in the back half. The recent pullback may have gone too far, but the broader market is looking rattled this year.

The long-term argument over NVDA is not resolved, which might be a good thing for patient investors. However, the near-term outlook is uncertain, and investors should be prepared for a potential downside in the stock price.
