The article discusses the potential of Cisco Systems (CSCO) stock going into its upcoming earnings report. Here are the key points:

1. **Positive outlook**: Analysts forecast a revenue increase of 3.5% year-over-year, and the company's track record of beating earnings suggests that this growth will continue.
2. **Strong fundamentals**: CSCO stock has a price-to-earnings (PE) ratio of around 19.5x, which is at the high end of recent years. This valuation, combined with predicted profit growth rates of 18.1% and 10.1%, makes double-digit returns in CSCO stock likely.
3. **Dividend aristocrat**: Cisco has a strong dividend history, having increased its payout every year since 2011. The current annual dividend yield is around 2.5%.
4. **Emerging technologies**: The company's investments in Wi-Fi 6 and 5G could drive growth and increase its position as a leader in the networking sector.
5. **Competitive landscape**: While Check Point Software, Arista Networks, and Palo Alto Networks are competitors, CSCO brings stability and income that may not be available from newer names.

The article concludes that Cisco stock is a good buy going into earnings, with potential rewards outweighing risks. However, it notes that buying into earnings can be riskier due to the recent rapid price appreciation.

**Recommendation**: Buy CSCO stock on pullbacks, and consider adding it to a portfolio as a growth and income play in the networking sector.
