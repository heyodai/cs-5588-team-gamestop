Based on the article, here is a summary of the points:

* Adobe's stock price is currently trading at around $300 and has a high target price of $340 set by analysts.
* The company's digital media segment is expected to grow by 20% in fiscal 2019, while its digital experience segment should see revenues grow by 34%.
* Adobe expects non-GAAP earnings per share to grow by 15% from $6.76 in 2018 to $7.80 in 2019.
* The company's price-to-sales and price-to-cash flow ratios are higher than its peers, making any growth below 20% a concern for investors.
* Valuation remains a major sticking point to a higher stock price, and the trade war could put tech investors in an extended selling mood, potentially pushing the share price down to $250 or lower.
* Long-term, Adobe stock is considered a winner by some analysts, but it's recommended to wait and see how the trade war plays out before buying.

Overall, the article suggests that while Adobe's growth prospects are strong, its high valuation and the uncertainty of the trade war make it challenging for the company to reach its target prices.
