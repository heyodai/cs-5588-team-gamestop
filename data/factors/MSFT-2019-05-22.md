**Cloud Tailwinds Will Push Microsoft Stock to $200**

The cloud market is expected to grow significantly in the long run, with 80% growth potential left. This will support continued robust growth in Office 365, Dynamics 365, and Azure. Microsoft's revenue-growth rate will remain in the double-digit range.

**Valuation Concerns**

However, valuation concerns arise due to a rich multiple of around 30 times forward earnings, nearly double the market-average multiple. Sentiment surrounding Microsoft is optimistic, which translates to limited room for multiple expansion over the next several years. Profit growth will be the primary driver of share price gains.

**Predictions**

Based on this analysis, $10 in earnings per share by 2025 is expected, with a forward earnings multiple of 20x. This suggests a price target of around $200 for Microsoft stock by 2024.

In summary, cloud tailwinds will continue to support Microsoft's growth, but valuation concerns may limit the extent of share price gains.
