The article discusses how Alphabet stock (GOOGL) has been declining recently due to concerns over advertising revenue and the company's overall performance. Here are some key points:

1. Advertising revenue is 88% of Alphabet's 2018 revenue, making it a crucial component of the company's growth.
2. Search revenue growth in the US and Europe has slowed down, with Amazon.com (AMZN) taking market share in online advertising.
3. Alphabet's non-search businesses, such as Waymo, Google Fiber, YouTube TV, and Google Cloud, have not performed well and contribute to the overall decline.
4. The company's operating margins have been compressing due to higher Traffic Acquisition Costs (TAC), but TAC declined as a percentage of revenue in Q1.
5. The fear is that Alphabet will need to adjust its expectations for earnings growth, which could lead to lower prices for the stock.

The article suggests that if earnings expectations are not met, Alphabet's stock price could drop further and potentially reach sub-$1,000 levels, similar to what happened during a December sell-off.

* Alphabet's advertising revenue is crucial to its growth.
