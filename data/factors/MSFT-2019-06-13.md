The article discusses several top analyst picks and price targets for various stocks. Here are the specific stocks and their corresponding analysts' recommendations:

1. **FIS Global**: Wedbush's Katri has a $140 price target (16% upside potential) calling FIS "significantly undervalued" compared to peers.
2. **Tempur Sealy International (TPX)**: Wedbush's Seth Basham has an Outperform rating and a $74 price target, citing favorable sales trends for the company's products, particularly the new Tempur Breeze line.
3. **Electronic Arts (EA)**: Michael Pachter promotes EA to best idea status with a $122 price target (32% upside potential), expecting material upside to guidance driven by Apex Legends and other strong games in the lineup.

Two stocks are being removed from the Best Ideas List:

1. **Dine Brands Global (DIN)**: Removed due to a less attractive risk/reward profile at current levels.
2. **Obseva (OBSV)**: Removed due to investment price discipline, as shares have plunged 20% year-to-date.

These analysts' recommendations and price targets suggest that FIS Global, Tempur Sealy International, and Electronic Arts are strong picks for investors looking to capitalize on their growth potential in the respective industries.
