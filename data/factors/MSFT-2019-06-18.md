Here's a summary of the article:

Magic Leap Inc., a US startup that makes a headset to project digital objects onto the real world, has accused one of its former engineers, Chi Xu, of stealing its technology to create his own augmented reality device for China. The lawsuit alleges that Xu exploited Magic Leap's confidential information to develop a prototype of mixed reality glasses similar to Magic Leap's designs. Xu founded Beijing-based Hangzhou Tairuo Technology Co., also known as Nreal, which unveiled its own augmented reality glasses at a trade show in January.

The case is significant because it highlights the tensions between American and Chinese companies over intellectual property theft. Magic Leap has invested heavily in developing its technology, which was released last August after seven years of work.

The lawsuit names Xu and Nreal as defendants, and accuses them of breach of contract, fraud, and unfair competition. Representatives at Nreal had no immediate comment on the lawsuit, while Xu did not respond to a message sent to his LinkedIn account.

This incident is part of a larger trend of Chinese companies being accused of stealing intellectual property from American firms. It's unclear whether anyone can turn augmented reality into a big money-spinner, but Magic Leap and other companies are likely to continue investing in the technology.
