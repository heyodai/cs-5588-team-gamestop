The article discusses Amazon's dominance in the market and how it has become a target for antitrust scrutiny. The author argues that Amazon's efforts to invest in new technologies, such as its own delivery trucks, airplanes, and drones, are being met with criticism and skepticism. The article suggests that the recent work of Lina Khan, who argued that Amazon should be made a common carrier, has contributed to this scrutiny.

The author also notes that any company that scales is subject to government control under Khan's conceptual framework, which would prohibit large companies from investing ahead of a market. This approach could stifle innovation and competition, as it would require companies to wait for the government to approve their investments before they can begin.

In contrast, the article suggests that history shows that antitrust scrutiny becomes internalized, and companies under government scrutiny become more adept at saying "no" to change and focus on profit and dividends rather than investing in infrastructure. The author argues that Amazon's stock price has suffered as a result of this scrutiny, and that investors should consider how much the criticism will cost the company in terms of profit and market gains.

Overall, the article presents a critical view of Lina Khan's approach to antitrust policy and suggests that it could have unintended consequences for innovation and competition. The author also notes that Amazon is not alone in facing this scrutiny, as other tech companies such as Facebook, Alphabet, and Apple are also being subject to similar criticism.
