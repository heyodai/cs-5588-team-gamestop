It appears that the article discusses the potential opportunity for investors in Google stock (GOOGL) due to the company's strategic focus on Artificial Intelligence (AI). The article highlights Google's early investment in AI, its acquisition of DeepMind, and the development of TensorFlow as a standard platform for creating AI models. Additionally, the article mentions Waymo, Google's autonomous vehicle division, which has made significant progress in developing autonomous driving technology.

The article suggests that while other companies like Microsoft (MSFT) and Facebook (FB) have seen more impressive returns on their investments in AI, Google stock may be a more attractive option due to its relatively lower valuation.

The article also mentions that Microsoft will close its ebook store later this month and delete all digital copies of books it sold, highlighting the potential risks of relying on digital storage and the importance of preserving cultural heritage in a rapidly changing digital landscape.

Overall, the article presents a case for why investors may want to consider Google stock as an opportunity due to its strong focus on AI and its potential for growth.
