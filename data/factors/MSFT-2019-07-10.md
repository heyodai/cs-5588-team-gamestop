Microsoft has opened its first European high-street presence in central London, just meters away from Apple's flagship store. The new store occupies three floors and 2,043 square meters of a historic building on Oxford Circus, one of the busiest pedestrian crossings in Europe.

According to Microsoft Chief Marketing Officer Chris Capossela, the company has been planning this expansion for multiple years and saw no impact from observations of Britain's struggling high streets. Instead, they drew inspiration from their successful US retail operations over the past decade.

The new store features a unique blend of white walls, wooden flooring, and furniture, with floor-to-ceiling video panels, laser-etching stations for product personalization, and conference rooms for training and education sessions. Customers can try out Microsoft's Hololens augmented-reality headset or pick up new laptops and charging cables.

The store also boasts a dedicated area for Xbox gamers and fans, featuring gaming lounges with webcams and headsets for e-sports tournaments. The building is situated in the upscale Oxford Circus area, just a short walk from Buckingham Palace.

While Capossela declined to comment on whether Microsoft plans to open other stores in the UK or Europe, the company's investment in this new location suggests they are committed to expanding their retail presence in key markets.
