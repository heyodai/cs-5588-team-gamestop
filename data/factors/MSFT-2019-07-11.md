To determine if Intel stock (INTC) is a buy eventually, we need to look at its current situation and prospects.

**Current Situation:**

*   Intel's price-to-earnings (PE) ratio is around 10.8, which is lower than the industry average.
*   The company has been struggling with slowing data center sales and losing its technical lead to AMD.
*   Recent headlines have been negative, mentioning Microsoft possibly sourcing processors from AMD or Qualcomm instead of Intel for the Microsoft Surface.

**Prospects:**

*   Intel needs a catalyst to inspire buying, similar to what happened with Nvidia (NVDA) when it applied its GPUs to AI, VR, and self-driving cars.
*   Two key technologies that could drive growth in Intel stock are 5G and autonomous vehicles. Mobileye has been testing self-driving taxis, and the company signed a contract to bring its technology to 8 million vehicles earlier this year.

**Target Valuation:**

*   If investors begin to believe in Intel again, the PE ratio may reach levels comparable to those of AMD (AMD) and NVDA, which could roughly triple the value of INTC.
*   A market cap of $211 billion at a PE ratio of 30 would increase to around $600 billion, while a PE ratio of 50 would bring it to $1 trillion.

**Conclusion:**

While Intel stock may struggle for some time to come, a change in technology could send it much higher long-term. Investors will need to wait for both 5G and autonomous vehicles to see more widespread adoption to see if this theory plays out. However, if Intel returns to prominence, it could unlock tremendous value, with a potential market cap of over $1 trillion.
