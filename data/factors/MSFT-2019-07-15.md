The article discusses the views of economist Philippe Aghion on the relationship between wealth concentration among the top 1% and innovation. Aghion argues that instead of focusing on punishing the wealthy, governments should aim to ensure that new innovators can challenge and replace incumbent companies, thereby fostering a more dynamic economy.

Aghion's perspective is rooted in his research on the role of competition in driving innovation and economic growth. He suggests that companies create new processes and products to generate "rents" (profits), which are then targeted by governments through policy measures such as taxation.

However, Aghion also notes that there are limitations to relying on higher taxes as a means to reduce wealth inequality. He cites the French experience in 2012, where tax reforms introduced by President Francois Hollande led to more of the ultra-rich leaving France, but with limited impact on social mobility.

Instead, Aghion advocates for a focus on robust competition enforcement, which he believes is a better answer to promote innovation and economic growth. He notes that companies like Amazon, Facebook, Google, and others have been subject to relatively little antitrust scrutiny, and that this may be changing as the European Union and US authorities begin to crack down on their quasi-monopolistic practices.

Overall, Aghion's views suggest that tackling wealth concentration through taxation alone is not enough to drive innovation and economic growth. Instead, governments should focus on creating a more competitive environment that encourages new entrants and disruptors to challenge established companies.

The article raises several key points:

1. **Wealth concentration is not necessarily a bad thing**: Aghion argues that the top 1% creates wealth through innovation, which can benefit society as a whole.
2. **Competition enforcement is key**: Aghion believes that robust competition enforcement is essential to drive innovation and economic growth.
3. **Taxation may not be effective**: Higher taxes on wealth and income may not necessarily lead to greater social mobility or economic growth, as seen in the French experience in 2012.
4. **Regulatory change can promote competition**: The European Union's fines on Google and other tech companies suggest that regulatory changes are underway to promote more competitive markets.

Overall, Aghion's views offer a nuanced perspective on the relationship between wealth concentration, innovation, and economic growth, highlighting the need for a more balanced approach to policy-making.
