The article discusses Qualcomm's stock and its potential for growth, despite some challenges. Here are the main points:

1. **Qualcomm's stock performance**: The company's stock fell after a spike in response to a letter from the US Department of Justice (DoJ), which accused Qualcomm of using "no license, no chips" tactics to gain monopoly power.
2. **European Union fine**: Qualcomm was also fined $272 million by the European Union for blocking Icera, a British modem chip maker, from entering the 3G baseband chip market a decade ago.
3. **Analyst reaction**: Barclays analyst Blayne Curtis downgraded Qualcomm due to the EU fine and the DoJ letter, which he calls "meritless" and "a political letter".
4. **Huawei potential rival**: China's Huawei is seen as a potential rival to Qualcomm in the 5G networking gear market.
5. **Koh decision impact**: The US District Court for the Northern District of California's ruling (Koh) has implications for Huawei, which may pivot to its own proprietary designs and come back stronger.
6. **Qualcomm's valuation**: The company is selling for less than four times its annual sales, with a dividend yield of 3.33%, making it more attractive compared to Adobe (NASDAQ:ADBE), which sells for over 15 times sales without a dividend.

The article concludes that Qualcomm's stock has potential growth due to the company's dominance in the 5G modem market and its ability to adapt to changing regulations. If Qualcomm loses and must adjust its business practices, it will still win a big share of the 5G marketplace.
