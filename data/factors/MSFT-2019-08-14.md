The article discusses how tech companies are shifting their production away from China due to the ongoing trade war between the US and China. The US has imposed tariffs on Chinese-made products, including electronics, which is hurting Taiwanese contract manufacturers such as Inventec Corp., Apple's assembler Hon Hai Precision Industry Co., and Microsoft Corp.

*   HP Inc., a laptop maker, plans to shift production of notebooks for the U.S. market out of China within months.
*   Inventec Corp. will move its entire American-bound laptop operation to its home base of Taiwan within two to three months.
*   The trade war is "very painful" for Taiwanese companies, according to Wu.
*   Rising tariffs on Chinese-made products threaten to wipe out their margins and up-end a well-oiled, decades-old supply chain.
*   Many Taiwanese contract manufacturers are now drawing up contingency plans, shifting select assembly operations or exploring alternative venues.

The article also mentions that the US and China are unlikely to reach a lasting agreement prior to the 2020 election, which provides certainty around tariff rates on imports from China.
