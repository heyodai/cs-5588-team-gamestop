The article discusses the outlook for International Business Machines (IBM) stock after its recent acquisition of Red Hat. The author notes that IBM's performance will depend on how well it absorbs Red Hat and whether this will lead to a turnaround in the company's earnings.

Key points about IBM stock include:

* The acquisition of Red Hat is expected to be completed by 2020, with IBM expecting modest growth in revenue and profits for fiscal 2019.
* Analysts expect IBM's forward price-to-earnings (PE) ratio to decrease due to the drop in stock price following the last earnings report.
* The dividend paid by IBM currently yields 4.9% but is expected to eat up more than 65% of the company's profits, which could lead to a reduction in the dividend if Red Hat fails to deliver growth.
* The author notes that cutting the dividend would be a risk for investors and could lead to years of stagnation.

The article concludes that investing in IBM stock is currently a gamble on the success of its acquisition of Red Hat. A favorable outcome could lead to a recovery in the stock price, while an unfavorable outcome could result in lower dividends and a stagnant or falling stock price.

Investors should exercise caution when considering purchasing IBM stock at this time, as the company's performance will depend on various factors related to its integration of Red Hat.
