The article discusses Salesforce (NYSE:CRM) stock, which has seen a 16% annualized gain since November 2018. Despite this growth, the author suggests that CRM stock remains a reliable option for investors looking to play the cloud. The company's recent Q2 results showed strong sales growth across its clouds and regions, with revenues increasing by 23%, 22%, and 36% in Sales Cloud, Service Cloud, and Marketing and Commerce Cloud, respectively. Additionally, Salesforce raised its guidance for fiscal 2020, indicating a potential increase in sales.

However, the author also notes that CRM stock has not kept pace with the growth of other cloud companies like Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), which have seen stronger returns in 2019. Additionally, Salesforce's valuation is not the cheapest among tech stocks, but its prospects for growth make it a viable option.

The author concludes that CRM stock remains a strong pick for investors looking to play the cloud, despite its relatively slower growth compared to other companies in the sector. They suggest that investors should be happy with slow and steady winning the race, rather than expecting the same level of long-term returns as in the past (29% annualized total return over 15 years).
