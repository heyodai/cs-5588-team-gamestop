Based on the article, here are the main points:

1. Apple's stock price has become stable but directionless due to uncertainty surrounding the company's new direction.
2. The trade war between the US and China is a major concern for Apple's revenue stream and supply chain.
3. Profit growth has slowed in recent years, and analysts expect annual earnings growth to fall for the first time in years.
4. iPhone sales have declined, and it remains unclear where the company will make up for the lost revenue.
5. The company's cash position is $210.6 billion, which could be used to fund acquisitions or expansion of Apple TV+ offerings.
