The article discusses GameStop (GME) stock and its recent struggles. Here are the main points:

1. **Decline of physical game sales**: The shift to digital delivery of games has hurt GameStop's business, as it loses out on initial sales and also misses out on the opportunity to trade in used games.
2. **Loss of console sales**: Console sales have been a significant contributor to GameStop's revenue in the past. However, with new console releases from Microsoft and Sony, console sales are expected to take a hit.
3. **Holiday season sales**: GameStop has struggled during the holiday season in recent years, with sales declining due to the shift to digital games and consoles.
4. **New generation of consoles**: The upcoming release of next-generation consoles could boost GameStop's sales in the fall of 2020, but this is not a guarantee of success for the company.
5. **Poor performance**: GameStop stock has been declining over the years, with a 94% drop from its peak in 2007.

The article concludes that GameStop's prospects are uncertain and that the company's future growth is unlikely to be driven by blockbuster console sales or digital game trades.
