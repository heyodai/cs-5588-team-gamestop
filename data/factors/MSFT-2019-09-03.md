The article discusses IBM (NYSE:IBM) stock, highlighting its potential for growth due to several factors:

1. **Red Hat acquisition**: The acquisition is expected to boost second-half 2019 revenues by about 2 percentage points, and 2020 by 4-5 percentage points.
2. **Free cash flow**: The Red Hat purchase will bolster IBM's free cash flow, enabling the company to return more money to its shareholders.
3. **Cloud computing**: Although IBM is behind rivals like Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), it has a strong presence in the growing cloud-computing market through its Cloud (a combination of SoftLayer and Bluemix) business, acquisition of Red Hat, and establishment of development platforms like Watson Developer Cloud.
4. **Blockchain**: IBM has meaningful advantages over its competitors in the blockchain space, particularly with its recently unveiled Trust Your Supplier (TYS) network, which aims to improve supplier qualification, validation, onboarding, and life cycle information management for corporate customers.

However, there are also some challenges and risks associated with IBM stock:

1. **Hardware business**: The company's hardware business is under pressure from intense competition from rivals like Oracle (NYSE:ORCL) and Cisco (NASDAQ:CSCO), which could lead to a small annual decline in revenue for this segment through 2023.
2. **Cloud software-as-a-service**: IBM needs to sharpen its focus on software-as-a-service, as the market is highly competitive.

Overall, the article suggests that IBM stock has positive aspects, particularly if the Red Hat acquisition proves to be a better deal than expected and the company increases its footprint in the SaaS market. The stock is currently trading at 10.53 times the average forward earnings estimate, making it a value play in a sector where investors are looking for growth.

**Key Takeaway**: IBM stock has potential for growth due to its cloud computing business, blockchain advantages, and free cash flow, but also faces challenges from intense competition in its hardware business and the need to sharpen its focus on software-as-a-service.
