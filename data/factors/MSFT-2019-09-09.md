Here's a summary of the article about Intel stock:

**Intel Stock: Buy with Caution**

* Intel (INTC) trades at 11.4 times forward earnings, lagging historic valuations by a wide margin.
* Despite this, late last month, I urged investors to buy Intel stock due to potential for 5G-related growth and trade talks.
* However, caution is advised as tech stocks have rallied on optimism about trade talks, and Intel has traded in a range between $44 to $59 per share for almost two years.
* If buying for the short-term, investors should exercise caution, as a deal could bring "sell the news" sentiment, while a failed deal could lead to a deflated mood.

**Long-term Investors Can Still Prosper**

* For long-term investors, buying now can still be a good strategy.
* Trade talks could finally lead to a deal, and Intel's stock might rally further from discussions.
* The ever-widening adoption of 5G should make Intel more valuable again over time.
* If trade does not help Intel, 5G probably will.

**The Bottom Line**

* Short-term traders should consider turning cautious due to the risk of a short-term reversal.
* Long-term investors can still buy Intel stock despite the recent run-up.
* The optimism has sent Intel's stock to the middle of its two-year trading range, and if it can reach and stay above $60 per share, we might see the long-awaited Intel comeback.
