The article argues that predictions about automation-induced joblessness are still largely science fiction and that policy proposals to counter this problem are often misguided. The author suggests that instead of trying to protect people from automation, we should focus on reducing inequality and boosting employment through other means, such as wealth taxes, basic income, and an expanded safety net.

The article criticizes a proposal by Bill de Blasio to tax companies that invest in automation, arguing that this would put US manufacturers at a disadvantage compared to global rivals and lead to job losses. The author also notes that De Blasio's plan would prevent the creation of new jobs in industries that benefit from technological improvements.

Instead, the author suggests that we should focus on implementing policies that promote economic growth and reduce inequality, such as:

* Wealth taxes: To address income inequality and redistribute wealth
* Basic income: To provide a safety net for workers who lose their jobs due to automation
* Expanded safety net: To support workers who are displaced by automation

The author concludes that the focus should be on addressing real problems, rather than trying to mitigate hypothetical ones.

Some key points from the article:

* Automation-induced joblessness is still largely science fiction
* Policy proposals to counter this problem are often misguided
* Focusing on reducing inequality and boosting employment through other means is a better approach
* Taxing companies that invest in automation would put US manufacturers at a disadvantage and lead to job losses
* Policies such as wealth taxes, basic income, and an expanded safety net could help address real problems.
