The article discusses the ongoing investigations into Google's practices by state attorneys general and the potential impact on Alphabet stock. Here are some key points:

1. **Investigations are widespread**: Nearly every state attorney general, including California and Alabama, is involved in the investigation, while the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico have also joined.
2. **Potential antitrust concerns**: The investigations are likely aimed at addressing Google's market dominance in search, advertising, and other areas, raising concerns about antitrust issues.
3. **Economic incentives**: Other states may be motivated to participate in the investigation due to their economic dependence on Alphabet's operations, such as digital advertising and job creation.
4. **Political implications**: The investigations could have significant political implications, particularly during the 2020 election cycle, where Google's search results and YouTube content will be closely scrutinized.
5. **Risk of increased scrutiny**: Critics have accused Google of unevenly policing content on YouTube, which could lead to increased regulatory scrutiny and potential fines.
6. **Splitting up Alphabet into separate entities**: Some analysts believe that if Alphabet were to split into separate operating companies, investors could gain better access to its successful businesses, such as Android, search, and advertising, potentially increasing the company's value.

Overall, the article suggests that Alphabet stock may face challenges due to the ongoing investigations, but also sees potential benefits from wise management decisions that could lead to increased shareholder value in the long run.
