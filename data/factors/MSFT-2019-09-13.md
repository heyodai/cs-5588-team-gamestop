The article discusses the upcoming IPO of TeamViewer AG, a German software maker, and how investors should approach it with caution. The author highlights several concerns:

1. High valuation: TeamViewer's valuation is 17 times its 2019 billings, which is relatively high compared to other tech companies.
2. Debt: The company has roughly 2 billion euros of net proceeds going to Permira, the private equity firm that will also keep a 58% stake. This means that investors may not be able to benefit from TeamViewer's growth if Permira decides to sell its shares or take profits.
3. Operating profit: Include the cost of servicing its borrowings, TeamViewer's operating profit turns into a net loss.
4. Debt-to-equity ratio: TeamViewer expects net debt to fall to 3.1 times cash Ebitda by the end of this year, but this is still above the level of other tech companies.
5. Cyberattack risk: As a company that offers software to monitor computers and equipment remotely, TeamViewer is vulnerable to cyberattacks.

The author concludes that potential shareholders should exercise caution when investing in TeamViewer's IPO, as there are significant risks involved. The high valuation and debt levels make it a less attractive investment compared to other tech companies.

In contrast, the article mentions ServiceNow Inc., a similar enterprise cloud software firm in the US, which trades at 12.5 times forward billings, indicating that investors may be willing to pay a lower price for a company with similar growth prospects.

Overall, the article is warning investors not to jump into TeamViewer's IPO without doing their due diligence and considering the risks involved.
