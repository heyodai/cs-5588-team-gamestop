The article discusses the potential end of the "unicorn era" in Silicon Valley, where startups are valued at over $1 billion. The author suggests that the IPO failure of WeWork could be a sign that this era is coming to an end, as it would force SoftBank and other investors to reevaluate their valuations and behavior. However, the article also notes that the current cycle in tech has been fueled by a number of factors, including the longest bull market in American history, a seemingly endless supply of venture capital, and the excitement over new technologies like the iPhone and Facebook.

The author argues that business cycles tend to last 7-10 years in Silicon Valley, and that this cycle should have ended by now. However, the tech boom continues, with companies like Uber, Lyft, Slack, and Dropbox still valued at high prices despite losing money or facing challenges. The article also notes that investors are becoming increasingly reckless, willing to overlook controversies and losses in order to get in on the next big thing.

The author suggests that it will take a significant event, such as an economic recession or the collapse of a major unicorn, to change the risk tolerance of conservative investors like endowments, pensions, and sovereign wealth funds. Until then, technologists will likely try to dismiss the WeWork IPO failure as an outlier, rather than a sign of a broader problem.

Overall, the article presents a skeptical view of the current tech boom and the valuations of startups in Silicon Valley. It argues that the era of unicorns may be coming to an end, but it's not clear what will take their place.
