The article discusses Bill Gates's philanthropic efforts through the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, which has donated over $36 billion since 1994. However, it also highlights some limitations of his approach to giving away money. While Gates and his wife have a sober and goal-oriented approach to philanthropy, they cannot operate programs on the scale that a wealthy nation's government does. The foundation's expenses are around $4.8 billion in 2018, which is comparable to the Republic of Georgia's annual government spending.

The article criticizes Gates for suggesting that governments should scrap wind and solar subsidies, as renewable energy still doesn't allow for natural market-based replacement of fossil fuel-burning plants. It suggests that a wealth tax could be a useful way for Gates to share more of his wealth with society. A 3% wealth tax on fortunes above $1 billion would have yielded $3.2 billion in taxes this year, which is more than the U.S. spent on wind and solar subsidies in 2016.

The article concludes that sharing more of Gates's wealth through taxes can be a useful complement to targeted philanthropy, rather than confiscating his "just rewards" of exceptional business acumen.
