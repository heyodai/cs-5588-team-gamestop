Based on the news articles provided, here are the top 5 factors that may affect the stock price of MSFT:

1. **Growth in AI adoption**: Microsoft UK's research suggests that organisations using AI are outperforming competitors by 11.5%, which could lead to increased demand for Microsoft's AI-related products and services.

2. **Global trade concerns**: The article mentions that investors set aside worries about the U.S.-China trade war, but the ongoing trade tensions may still impact MSFT's stock price if they lead to tariffs or other regulatory changes affecting the tech industry.

3. **Competition in the tech sector**: Apple is struggling to reverse shrinking iPhone sales amid tepid global demand for smartphones, which could put pressure on Microsoft's own smartphone market share and product sales.

4. **Company leadership and vision**: Microsoft President Brad Smith's comments on the need for tech companies to address issues caused by the tech boom, including homelessness, may impact investor confidence in the company's direction and commitment to social responsibility.
