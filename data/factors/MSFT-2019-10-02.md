The article discusses the challenges faced by PlayStation Now, a game streaming service from Sony. The main reasons for its failure are:

1. **Overpriced**: PlayStation Now costs $19.99 per month, which is too expensive compared to other subscription services like Nintendo's Switch Online ($3.99) and Microsoft's Xbox Game Pass ($9.99).
2. **Limited appeal**: PlayStation Now has only 700,000 paid subscribers out of 96.8 million PlayStation 4 units sold, indicating a lack of interest among gamers.
3. **Competition from rival offers**: Sony's own service, PlayStation Plus, is cheaper and offers more benefits than PlayStation Now.

To improve its chances, Sony should:

1. **Lower the price**: Cutting the cost to $9.99 per month could attract more subscribers and increase revenue.
2. **Offer a bundled service**: Combining PlayStation Now with PlayStation Plus or offering a discounted package for both services could appeal to customers who want access to a wider range of games.
3. **Learn from competitors**: Sony can study how Netflix, Spotify, and other streaming services have successfully offered competitive pricing and packages to attract more users.

The article concludes that by adopting these strategies, Sony can revitalize its PlayStation Now service and potentially capture a larger share of the growing gaming subscription market.
