However, despite this bearish sign, Amazon's stock bounced back 1.6% in morning trading on Friday.

The article also mentions that the last time a death cross appeared was on December 12, after Amazon's stock had lost 18% from its September 4, 2018 record close of $2,039.51. The stock fell another 19% in 8 sessions before bottoming out.
