The article discusses the potential breakout buy of Apple (AAPL) stock, highlighting its technical analysis and chart patterns. The author notes that AAPL has been cautious in its price movement, hitting new highs but not with explosive bullishness. However, the broader market is holding up, and trade talks between the US and China are making progress, which could impact stocks.

The article mentions two important marks on Apple's daily chart: a breakout above $215 in September and a recent test of that level. The stock has since held above this mark and is now trading above $230, its former adjusted high of $229.92. The author suggests that AAPL may continue higher if the broader market holds up and/or trades higher.

Key points to watch for on the downside include a pullback down to channel support and the 20-day moving average. Below that puts the 50-day moving average on the table, with another possible test of $215 below that.

The author concludes that technically speaking, the charts look great for Apple stock, and if the broader market can stay afloat this quarter, AAPL may forge even higher going into year-end. Additionally, iPhone demand appears strong, and sentiment is turning bullish.

Overall, the article suggests that investors should consider buying Apple stock if they believe in its potential to continue higher. However, it's essential to be cautious of negative developments between the US and China, which could impact stocks.
