Based on the news articles provided, here are the top 5 factors that may affect the stock price of MSFT:

1. **Cloud Sales Growth**: Microsoft's cloud sales grew 59% in the latest quarter, which is a significant increase compared to Amazon Web Services (35%). However, Microsoft still lags behind Amazon in market share (15.5% vs. 47.8%), so further growth will be crucial to catch up.

2. **Subscription-Based Model**: As mentioned in the "10 'Autopay' Dividend Stock Picks to Subscribe To" article, a subscription-based model can generate predictable and recurring revenues, which can be attractive to investors. Microsoft's Azure cloud platform has already adopted this approach with its subscription services.

3. **Partnerships and Contracts**: The recent $10 billion Pentagon contract won by Microsoft is a significant win for the company, but it also highlights the competitive nature of the cloud computing market. Additional partnerships and contracts will be crucial to drive growth and increase investor confidence.

4. **Earnings Per Share (EPS)**: The article mentions that stock buybacks can "juice" EPS figures, which means that Microsoft's decision to repurchase shares could lead to increased EPS. However, this is not a direct effect on the stock price, but rather a factor that can influence investor sentiment.

5. **Competition from Amazon and Other Cloud Providers**: The article highlights Amazon's strong market share (47.8%) in public cloud computing services, which puts pressure on Microsoft to maintain its growth trajectory. The competition from other cloud providers, such as Alibaba Group Holding, will also be important to consider when evaluating MSFT's stock price.

These factors can impact MSFT's stock price by influencing investor sentiment, driving growth, and shaping the company's competitive position in the cloud computing market.
