The article discusses the current situation of Yes Bank, an Indian private sector bank that is facing a crisis. The bank has reported a significant loss in its September quarter and has $3 billion in rescue offers from various investors, including a North American family office, global buyout funds, and Indian mutual funds.

The CEO of Yes Bank, Gill, has stated that the bank needs to raise capital urgently and has informed the local stock exchanges about the binding offer of $1.2 billion from the North American family office. However, regulatory approvals are uncertain, and the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) may have to bless the price at which new equity is sold.

The article highlights the challenges in raising capital for Yes Bank, including:

1. Regulatory hurdles: The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has strict regulations around bank acquisitions, and it's unclear whether the RBI will allow a single investor to own more than 10% of the bank.
2. Volatility in stock prices: The sudden news of the planned rescue offer has caused volatility in Yes Bank's stock price, making it difficult for investors to make informed decisions.
3. Uncertainty around the terms of the rescue: The article notes that there is no clarity on how many shares will be sold and at what price, which is a critical aspect of any fundraising effort.

The article concludes that Yes Bank needs to navigate these challenges carefully to raise capital effectively and restore its financial stability.
