The article discusses the potential benefits of mandating shorter workweeks in countries where employees are working inefficiently long days. The author suggests that four-day workweeks like Microsoft's Japan office or more paid vacation days could help improve productivity and work-life balance.

Some possible solutions to address the issue of overwork include:

*   Mandating shorter hours through four-day workweeks, shorter workdays, or more paid vacation
*   Implementing policies to punish companies for requiring unpaid overtime
*   Encouraging partnerships between companies and workers to prioritize results over hours worked

The article highlights that countries like France have already implemented some of these measures, resulting in higher levels of per-hour productivity.
