A merchant is filing a complaint with the US House Antitrust Committee, alleging that Amazon's control of its marketplace lets it coerce merchants into buying its logistics services. The merchant claims that Amazon uses "carrots and sticks" to force sellers to use Fulfillment by Amazon (FBA), which provides fast and reliable shipping, but also comes at a higher cost.

The complaint points to the 1984 Supreme Court ruling on tying arrangements, which states that the essential characteristic of an invalid tying arrangement lies in the seller's exploitation of its control over the tying product to force the buyer into purchasing a tied product they did not want. The merchant alleges that Amazon uses this tactic to force merchants to buy FBA services.

However, Amazon denies the allegations, saying that products offered by merchants using its logistics services tend to be more prominent in search results due to Amazon's better and more reliable shipping experience. The company claims that its search algorithm is not biased towards FBA, but rather because Amazon logistics "generally provides a better and more reliable experience for our customers than fulfillment through other means."

The merchant's complaint also points out that despite slow delivery times with FBA, the logistics fees are 35% higher than other rapid shipping options offered by UPS and the US Postal Service. The merchant argues that merchants decide to use Amazon's logistics services despite these slower delivery times because it protects them from being kicked off the platform when deliveries are late.

The complaint highlights the tension between Amazon's desire to control its marketplace and the concerns of its merchants about using FBA services. If the complaint is successful, it could have implications for Amazon's dominance in the e-commerce market and its relationships with its sellers.
