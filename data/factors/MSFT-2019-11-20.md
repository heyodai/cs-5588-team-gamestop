The article discusses Amazon's grocery business, specifically its physical stores and the growth of its online grocery sales. Here are some key points:

* Amazon's physical grocery stores saw a 1% decline in same-store sales for the third quarter, excluding Whole Foods delivery orders or purchases made for pickup in stores.
* This figure is lower than the company's earlier reported adjusted figures, which suggested a growth rate of 5-6%.
* The strategic and financial costs associated with Amazon's grocery initiatives are significant, including its acquisition of Whole Foods and investments in Go stores.
* While the Go stores have received attention for their cashier-less technology, they are not considered a success so far, and Amazon has been less ambitious with their rollout than initially planned.
* Technology companies like Microsoft and Amazon are exploring ways to license their technologies, such as AI-powered checkout systems, to non-Amazon supermarkets or other retail stores.
* The article questions whether retailers that compete with Amazon will be willing to pay to use technology from a competitor, suggesting that Amazon may have less time to experiment than in the past.
* The experience of shopping for groceries could benefit from fresh ideas and approaches, but the author is skeptical that Amazon has them.

Overall, the article highlights challenges faced by Amazon's grocery business, including declining same-store sales and significant investments. However, it also notes the potential benefits of technology and innovation in the grocery space, particularly through licensed platforms or partnerships with other retailers.
