The article discusses two attempts to reform the internet: Tim Berners-Lee's Solid project and Mozilla's Brave browser. Both projects aim to address issues such as data harvesting, online tracking, and the monetization of personal data without user consent.

Berners-Lee's Solid project aims to create a decentralized web where users can control their own personal data and applications can access it with permission. However, despite three years of development, the project is still not widely known or adopted, and popular websites continue to use Google or Facebook login options rather than Solid PODs (personal online data stores).

Mozilla's Brave browser, on the other hand, has made more progress in addressing these issues. It allows users to sign up for blockchain-based "basic attention tokens," which can be used to pay for eligible services. The browser has 8 million monthly active users and some 37,000 content creators who accept the tokens.

However, both projects face significant challenges from internet giants such as Google, Facebook, and Twitter, which are resistant to changing their business models to make them less harmful. Berners-Lee and Mozilla's founder Brendan Eich have acknowledged that these companies will not easily adopt their solutions, but they continue to promote their ideas through public awareness campaigns.

The article concludes that while both projects are great ideas, it is unclear if they can overcome the resistance of internet giants to create meaningful change. The author notes that Amazon was not among the signatories of Berners-Lee's initiative at the time of writing, which could be seen as hypocritical.

Overall, the article suggests that reforming the internet will require a sustained effort from individuals and organizations who are committed to creating a better online experience for users.
