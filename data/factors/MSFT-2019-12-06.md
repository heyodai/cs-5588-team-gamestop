The article discusses WeWork's turnaround efforts under Marcelo Claure, who was named executive chairman after SoftBank's investment in the company. Lane, the CEO of WeWork, is optimistic about the company's future prospects, predicting revenue growth to $1.5 billion and an enterprise value of $28.8 billion by 2025.

Key points from the article include:

* WeWork is transitioning from a niche provider of space for entrepreneurs to offering flexible real estate as a service.
* The company aims to make $500 per month on memberships, similar to software as a service (SaaS) models.
* SoftBank's Marcelo Claure will focus on profitability by stopping expansion and slashing overhead.
* WeWork estimates that its revenue will rise to $1.5 billion if it can achieve 90% occupancy on its current portfolio.
* The company projects an enterprise value of $28.8 billion by 2025, which would be worth about $19.1 billion for SoftBank's 80% stake.

The article suggests that WeWork's valuation is justified if the "office space" market becomes a managed service outsourced to professionals, and that the company will be the leading global player in this field.
