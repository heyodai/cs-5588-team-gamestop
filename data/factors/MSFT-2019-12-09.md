The Chinese government is taking further steps to remove foreign technology from state agencies and other organizations as part of its efforts to increase independence amid escalating tensions with the US. Here are some key points:

* Beijing plans to replace around 20 million computers at government agencies with domestic products over the next three years.
* More than 100 trial projects for domestic products were completed in July, according to research from China Securities.
* The Communist Party's Central Office earlier this year ordered state offices and public institutions to shift away from foreign hardware and software.
* The country's Made in China 2025 plan aimed to purge most foreign technology from its banks, military, government agencies, and state-owned enterprises by 2020.
* US President Donald Trump's aggressive policies against China have given the effort renewed urgency.
* The goal is to substitute 30% of hardware in state agencies next year, 50% in 2021, and 20% in 2022, according to China Securities estimated.
* Chinese banks are supposed to shift from International Business Machines Corp. and Oracle Corp. to more diversified X86 architecture suppliers and then eventually to fully made-in-China hardware.

However, the push has proven difficult due to China's domestic industry not yet showing itself capable of matching foreign technologies in certain sectors.
