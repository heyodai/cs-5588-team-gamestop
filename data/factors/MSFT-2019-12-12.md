The article discusses Nintendo's potential success in the Chinese market with its Switch console. The company has begun selling the console in China and is expected to generate significant revenue from it. However, the optimism is tempered by the historically poor performance of other video game consoles in China and Beijing's strict regulations on gaming. Despite this, analysts believe that Nintendo's Switch could still perform well in China, with sales ranging between 2 million and 4 million units in fiscal 2019 and between 3 million and 6 million units in the following year. The company is also expected to generate significant revenue from software sales, with estimates ranging between 6 million and 12 million units in the current period and 15 million and 30 million units in the period ending March 2021.
