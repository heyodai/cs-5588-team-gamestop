Based on the news articles provided, here are the top 5 factors that may affect the stock price of MSFT (Microsoft):

1. **Business App Development**: Microsoft's "Power Platform" offerings, including Power BI, Power Apps, Power Automate, and Power Virtual Agents, have the potential to be a big growth opportunity for the company, according to Evercore ISI analyst Kirk Materne.

2. **Government Contracts**: The company received a key provisional security nod, which is a significant development in its bid to take on the DOD's massive cloud contract. This could lead to increased revenue and stock price growth.

3. **Blockchain Adoption**: As blockchain services gain mainstream adoption in 2020, driven by breakthrough product roll-outs and noteworthy partnerships, Microsoft may benefit from this trend, particularly if it has a presence in the space.

4. **5G Opportunity**: The growing demand for 5G phones and newly launched gaming consoles could create a new market opportunity for Western Digital's chips, which are used by Microsoft. This could lead to an increase in sales and stock price growth.

5. **Cybersecurity and Cloud Computing**: As the company continues to expand its security offerings, including its SOAR technology, and invests in cloud computing, it may see increased demand from customers looking for secure and scalable solutions, leading to higher revenue and stock price growth.

Note that these factors are not necessarily direct drivers of MSFT's stock price but rather potential influences on the company's future growth prospects.
