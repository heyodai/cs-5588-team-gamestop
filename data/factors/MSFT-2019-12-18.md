Based on the provided news articles, here are the top 5 factors that may affect the stock price of MSFT (Microsoft):

1. **Tech Intensity and Competitive Advantage**: Microsoft's adoption of 'tech intensity' as a key driver of competitive advantage is gaining traction across industries. This trend is expected to drive demand for Azure services and enterprise productivity offerings, potentially leading to increased revenue growth.
2. **Kubernetes Adoption and Cloud Computing**: The growing popularity of Kubernetes is expected to have a significant impact on Microsoft's cloud computing business. As more companies adopt Kubernetes, Microsoft is well-positioned to benefit from the increasing demand for its Azure platform.
3. **Azure Client Base Expansion**: Microsoft's expanding Azure client base is driving revenue growth and margin expansion for the company. This trend is likely to continue in 2020, supporting the stock price of MSFT.
4. **Trade Tensions and Huawei Ban**: The ongoing trade tensions between the US and China, particularly with regards to Huawei, may have a negative impact on Microsoft's stock price. However, if the ban is relaxed or companies find alternative ways to operate around it, MSFT could benefit from increased sales of its Azure services.
5. **Growth at a Reasonable Price (GARP) Strategy**: As highlighted in the article "Best Stocks of the Year: Microsoft Is Number 3", Microsoft's market cap soared above $1 trillion in 2019 due to its GARP strategy, which focuses on delivering solid revenue growth and margin expansion while maintaining a reasonable price-to-earnings ratio. If MSFT continues to execute this strategy effectively, it may support the stock price of MSFT.

These factors are not exhaustive, but they are some of the key drivers that may affect the stock price of MSFT based on the provided news articles.
