Based on the provided news articles, here are the top 5 factors that may affect the stock price of NVDA (Nvidia Corporation):

1. **Intel's Chip Vulnerability Disclosure**: A recent disclosure by Intel about a vulnerability in its chips has affected other companies' products and could lead to increased sales for Nvidia as investors size up the potential winners and losers. This could positively impact NVDA's stock price.
2. **Artificial Intelligence (AI) Popularity Growth**: The growing popularity of AI technology, including its applications in machine learning and deep learning, is expected to drive growth in the semiconductor industry. As a leader in AI-related technologies, NVDA's stock price may benefit from this trend.
3. **Increased Demand for Virtual Reality (VR) Technology**: Sony's virtual reality headset has gained significant popularity, driving strong demand for VR technology. This could positively impact NVDA's stock price if the company is able to capitalize on the growing demand for AI-powered VR solutions.
4. **Advanced Micro Devices' (AMD) Chip Sales Growth**: The vulnerability in Intel chips may be a "marketing edge" for AMD and Nvidia, as investors may shift their focus to these companies' products. As a competitor to AMD in the gaming and datacenter markets, NVDA's stock price may benefit from this increased demand.
5. **Nvidia's Strong Quarterly Performance**: With its new base lacking certain key ingredients, investing action plans are being explored for Nvidia's potential entry into the tech leader space. A strong quarterly performance could positively impact NVDA's stock price, driven by investors' confidence in the company's future growth prospects.

Note that these factors may have varying impacts on NVDA's stock price, and some may be more significant than others.
