Based on the news articles, here are the top 5 factors that may affect the stock price of NVDA (NVIDIA):

1. **Cryptocurrency Mining**: NVIDIA's graphics cards are in high demand by cryptocurrency miners, which is driving up prices and causing shortages. This is a concern for PC gamers who rely on these same cards.

2. **Price Gouging**: The sudden surge in demand from cryptocurrency miners has led to price gouging, making it difficult for PC enthusiasts to purchase graphics cards at affordable prices. This could impact NVIDIA's sales and revenue.

3. **Competition from AMD**: As a competitor in the semi-conductor industry, AMD (Advanced Micro Devices) is gaining traction with its RISC-V technology. If AMD can successfully compete with NVIDIA in terms of innovation and pricing, it could erode NVDA's market share.

4. **Innovation and Product Releases**: NVIDIA's innovative products, such as its Pascal card, have shown strong user adoption. The company's ability to continue innovating and releasing new products will be key to maintaining its competitive edge and driving up stock prices.

5. **Pricing and Valuation**: Despite BofA's positive assessment of NVDA's stock, the price-to-earnings ratio is still relatively high at 57. If NVIDIA's growth slows down or if investors become more cautious about the company's valuation, this could lead to a decline in stock prices.

Note that these factors are not exhaustive and other news articles may have mentioned additional factors that could impact NVDA's stock price.
