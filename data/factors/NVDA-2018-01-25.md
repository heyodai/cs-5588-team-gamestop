Based on the news articles, here are the top 5 factors that may affect the stock price of NVDA (NVIDIA):

1. **Artificial Intelligence and Cloud Computing Trends**: NVIDIA's success in the AI and cloud computing space has been a key driver of its growth in recent years. As these trends continue to evolve, NVDA's stock price may be influenced by its ability to capitalize on them.
2. **Competition from AMD**: The article mentions that AMD is a niche player in the semiconductor chipmaking sector, but it also notes that AMD has escaped some of the security issues that have affected Intel. If AMD's stock price rises due to its improved performance or if it becomes a more significant competitor to NVDA, it could negatively impact NVDA's stock price.
3. **Valuation and Fundamental Analysis**: The article mentions that Micron Technology's (MU) PE ratio is currently low, which could make its stock price more attractive to investors. Similarly, the valuation of NVIDIA's stock may be affected by fundamental analysis, such as its earnings per share, revenue growth, and market position.
4. **Industry Trends and Regulations**: The article mentions that there are no major regulatory issues affecting NVDA at this time, but it also notes that Intel is dealing with security issues related to Meltdown and Spectre. Any changes in industry trends or regulations could impact NVDA's stock price.
5. **Global Economic Conditions and Trade Policies**: The article does not mention specific economic indicators or trade policies that may affect NVDA's stock price. However, global economic conditions and trade policies can have a significant impact on the semiconductor industry as a whole, and any changes in these areas could potentially affect NVDA's stock price.

It is worth noting that these are just potential factors that may affect NVDA's stock price, and there may be other factors at play that are not mentioned in the articles.
