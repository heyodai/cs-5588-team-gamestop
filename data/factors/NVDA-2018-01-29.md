Based on the news articles provided, here are the top 5 factors that may affect the stock price of NVDA (NVIDIA Corporation):

1. **Autonomous Vehicle Market Growth**: NVIDIA's design win in the autonomous vehicle platform with Aquantia and other companies may drive demand for its processing engines, leading to increased revenue and stock price.
2. **Intel's Chip Design Flaw**: The security vulnerability in Intel's chip may create an opportunity for AMD to regain market share in PC and server CPU markets, potentially benefiting NVDA as well due to their joint presence in the market.
3. **Rise of Mining Bitcoin and Other Cryptocurrencies**: The skyrocketing price of graphic cards and system memory due to mining bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies may be bad news for large consumers and PC gamers, but it could also drive up demand for hardware components from NVDA.
4. **Seasonal Demand**: As seasonal demand from game console companies typically fades during the fourth quarter, AMD's revenue may slow down, which could impact NVDA's stock price as well.
5. **Investor Expectations and Momentum**: With high investor expectations going into NVIDIA's Q4 earnings report, a strong performance may drive up the stock price, given the company's recent momentum and growth in the market.

Note that these factors are not exhaustive and may interact with each other in complex ways to affect NVDA's stock price.
