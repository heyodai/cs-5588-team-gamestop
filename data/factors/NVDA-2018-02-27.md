Based on the provided news articles, here are the top 5 factors that may affect the stock price of NVDA (NVIDIA):

1. **Artificial Intelligence Revolution**: NVIDIA's strong position in the AI revolution and its role at the heart of this technology may drive up its stock price as investors seek to capitalize on the growth opportunities in AI.
2. **Momentum ETF Performance**: The performance of a momentum ETF that includes NVIDIA has shown that the momentum factor is still in style, which could positively impact NVDA's stock price if other momentum stocks continue to perform well.
3. **Positive Analyst Estimates**: Wall Street analysts have become bullish on NVIDIA, with the average price target increasing by 11% from $275 in January 2018 to $305 in February 2018. This positive sentiment can contribute to a higher stock price.
4. **Competitive Landscape**: The emergence of Bitmain Technologies, a highly profitable Chinese company developing cryptocurrency-mining hardware, may create headaches for NVIDIA, AMD, and Qualcomm. If this competition leads to increased innovation or market share loss for NVDA, its stock price could be affected negatively.
5. **Growth Strategies**: CA Inc's sound growth strategies, which have driven its top and bottom line performances, may serve as a positive example for other companies, including NVIDIA. Investors may take notice of CA Inc's success and apply similar strategies to their own portfolio, potentially leading to increased demand for NVDA stock.
