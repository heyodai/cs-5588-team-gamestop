Based on the provided news articles, here are the top 5 factors that may affect the stock price of NVDA (NVIDIA):

1. **Cryptocurrency Mining Slowdown**: NVIDIA's business is heavily dependent on the demand for graphics processing units (GPUs) from cryptocurrency miners. A slowdown in this demand could negatively impact the company's revenue and stock price.
2. **Partnership with Intel**: The partnership between NVIDIA and Intel to bring AMD's discrete GPU technology to Intel's laptop CPUs could potentially disrupt NVIDIA's market share in the PC gaming segment, which could lead to a decline in NVDA's stock price.
3. **Chip Flaws at Advanced Micro Devices (AMD)**: Although investors have largely shrugged off reports of chip flaws at AMD, it is still possible that the issue could affect consumer confidence and ultimately impact NVDA's stock price if there are concerns about the reliability or quality of NVIDIA's products as well.
4. **Global Economic Downturn**: The Dow Jones industrial average outperformed by a wide margin in afternoon trading on Thursday, suggesting that investors may be optimistic about the state of the economy. A global economic downturn could negatively impact NVDA's stock price if it leads to reduced consumer spending and lower demand for its products.
5. **Competition from Qorvo**: The recent announcement of Qorvo Inc.'s (QRVO) new world's highest power GaN-On-SiC RF transistor may pose a threat to NVIDIA's market share in the RF and high-performance computing segments, which could lead to a decline in NVDA's stock price if Qorvo is able to gain significant traction with its product.
