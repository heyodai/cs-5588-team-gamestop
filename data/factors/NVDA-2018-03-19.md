Unfortunately, none of these news articles mention NVDA specifically, which is a stock symbol for NVIDIA Corporation.

However, I can infer some potential factors that may affect the stock price of NVDA based on related news articles:

1. **Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Gaming**: As mentioned in "10 Reasons to Buy NVIDIA Stock -- and Hold On for the Long Term" and "Nvidia And Microsoft Lay Foundation For Photorealistic Gaming With Real-Time Ray Tracing", AI and gaming are growing markets that could impact NVDA's stock price.
2. **Crypto-Currency Mining**: Although this article is about Intel, it highlights the importance of computer processing power in crypto-currency mining, which may affect demand for NVIDIA GPUs.
3. **Automotive and Autonomous Driving**: Intel's focus on AI and 5G (as mentioned in "Intel Targets Artificial Intelligence and 5G") could impact NVDA's stock price, potentially if there is a shift towards using NVIDIA GPUs in autonomous driving applications.

Without specific news articles about NVDA, it's difficult to pinpoint the top 5 factors that may affect its stock price. However, based on related news articles, these potential factors may be worth considering:

1. Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Gaming
2. Crypto-Currency Mining
3. Autonomous Driving (potentially impacted by Intel's efforts)
4. Gaming Industry Growth (specifically photorealistic gaming with real-time ray tracing)
5. Market Trends and Sentiment (e.g., the overall market direction, analyst opinions, etc.)

Keep in mind that these are just potential factors and may not necessarily be directly related to NVDA's stock price.
