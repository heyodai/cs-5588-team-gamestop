Based on the provided news, I extracted the top 5 factors that may affect the stock price of NVDA (Nvidia Corporation):

1. **White House chaos and potential government regulations**: The article mentions Jim Cramer's game plan for investors to be prepared for more White House chaos, which could lead to changes in government policies and regulations affecting the tech industry, including Nvidia.
2. **Growth in robotics and AI industry**: The news highlights the growing exponential growth of the robotics and AI industry, which is expected to drive innovation and demand for related technologies, potentially benefiting Nvidia's stock price.
3. **Diversification in stocks**: The article mentions Facebook (FB) as an example of a company that benefits from diversification in its portfolio, suggesting that investors may seek to diversify their portfolios to mitigate risks associated with volatility in the tech industry.
4. **Wall Street panic and market reversals**: The news reports on the recent stock price fluctuations, including a reversal of key market indices, which could lead to increased volatility and uncertainty in the market, potentially affecting Nvidia's stock price.
5. **Competition from Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (TSM)**: The article mentions TSM as a top 10 SAFE International Dividend Stock, suggesting that competition from Taiwanese companies like TSM may put pressure on Nvidia's stock price due to increased supply and pricing competition.

These factors may have a significant impact on the stock price of NVDA, although their relative importance can vary depending on market conditions and investor sentiment.
