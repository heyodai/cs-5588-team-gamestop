Based on the text, here are three blue chip tech stocks to consider buying:

1. **Red Hat (RHT)**: The company's fiscal Q4 results exceeded analysts' expectations, with software billings rising 25% year-over-year. The stock is up $6.93, or almost 5%, at $160.02.
2. **Lam Research (LRCX)**: Despite an upbeat note, the company's shares are declining. However, it may be a buying opportunity for those who missed out on the recent rally.
3. **Nvidia (NVDA)**: The stock could potentially explode 10% higher if a U.S.-China trade deal is reached. Charts show a potential rally for the tech darling, but also warn of a pullback if tensions worsen.

These stocks are all considered blue chip and have strong fundamentals, making them potential buys for investors looking to rebound from recent selloffs. However, it's always important to do your own research and consider your own risk tolerance before making any investment decisions.
