Based on the provided news articles, here are the top 5 factors that may affect the stock price of NVDA (NVIDIA):

1. **Cryptocurrency Plunge**: The recent decline in cryptocurrency prices, particularly Bitcoin's fall below $7,000, has led to concerns about the impact on GPU makers like NVIDIA. This could potentially reduce demand for GPUs, affecting NVDA's sales and stock price.

2. **Bitmain's Ethereum ASIC**: The introduction of Bitmain's new ASIC (application-specific integrated circuit) for Ethereum mining could lead to a shift in cryptocurrency-related sales away from AMD and NVIDIA. This could negatively impact NVDA's sales, especially if the ASIC is more efficient than current GPUs.

3. **Supply and Demand Imbalance**: The crypto boom has led to a supply shortage of GPUs, driving up prices. However, if this trend reverses, it could lead to decreased demand for GPUs, affecting NVDA's stock price.

4. **Commodity Price Volatility**: As memory chips are commodities, fluctuations in their prices can impact NVDA's sales and stock price. A decline in the price of memory chips could reduce demand for NVIDIA's products.

5. **Industry Competition and Market Trends**: The rise of AMD's success has raised concerns about the potential competition between the two companies in the GPU market. If investors reassess just how much of AMD's recent success was based on the cryptocurrency boom, it could negatively impact NVDA's stock price if they believe their sales are also heavily reliant on this trend.

These factors may affect NVDA's stock price due to their potential impact on the company's sales, revenue, and overall market position.
