Based on the news articles, here are the top 5 factors that may affect the stock price of NVDA:

1. **Self-driving cars**: The development and adoption of self-driving cars is a significant growth area for NVIDIA, with many companies investing in autonomous vehicle technology. The company's GPU products are being used in these applications.
2. **Artificial Intelligence (AI)**: NVIDIA's strength in AI is also its biggest threat, as the company's AI-powered GPUs are becoming increasingly popular in various industries, including gaming, healthcare, and finance.
3. **Crypto mining**: NVIDIA's GPU products were initially popular among cryptocurrency miners, but the company has shifted away from this market due to the decline of Ethereum's value. The impact on NVDA's stock price will depend on whether other applications can fill the void left by crypto mining.
4. **Competition from AMD**: As a competitor in the GPU market, NVIDIA's stock price may be affected by AMD's performance and growth prospects, particularly if AMD is able to gain significant market share in areas like gaming or professional graphics.
5. **ETF inflows**: The increasing popularity of ETFs tracking the semiconductor industry, such as SMH (Semiconductor ETF), can impact NVDA's stock price due to increased demand for its products.

These factors are likely to influence NVIDIA's stock price, particularly if they continue to shape the company's growth prospects and competitive landscape.
