Based on the provided news articles, here are the top 5 factors that may affect the stock price of NVDA (NVIDIA Corporation):

1. **Advancements in Artificial Intelligence and Robotics**: NVIDIA's dominance in the AI and robotics markets could lead to increased demand for its graphics processing units (GPUs) and autonomous driving solutions. This could drive up the company's stock price.

2. **Intel's Decline due to In-House AI Chip Failure**: Intel's acquisition of Nervana Systems, which was supposed to allow it to compete with NVIDIA in the market for processors that handle neural network training, may not be as successful as expected. If this is true, it could negatively impact NVDA's stock price.

3. **Autonomous Vehicle Adoption**: The growth of autonomous vehicles and the increasing adoption of AI-powered driving systems could lead to increased demand for NVIDIA's GPUs and autonomous driving solutions, driving up the company's stock price.

4. **Cryptocurrency Mining Demand**: As cryptocurrency prices continue to fluctuate, the demand for mining equipment and software could increase or decrease, affecting NVDA's stock price. However, if investors are looking to invest in cryptocurrency mining, NVIDIA's GPU technology is often considered a key component.

5. **ETF Outflows from Semiconductors and AI ETFs**: The outflow of shares from iShares PHLX Semiconductor ETF (SOXX) and the decline in week-over-week share outstanding changes may indicate decreased investor confidence in semiconductors and AI-related stocks, which could negatively impact NVDA's stock price.
