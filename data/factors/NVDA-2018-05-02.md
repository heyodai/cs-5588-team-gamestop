Based on the provided news articles, the top 5 factors that may affect the stock price of NVDA (NVIDIA) are:

1. **Competition from Intel's crypto mining chip**: The emergence of Intel's new patent for a System on a Chip (SOC) designed to accelerate bitcoin mining and reduce power consumption could potentially disrupt NVIDIA's dominance in the market.

2. **Risk aversion among investors**: The recent outflows from emerging markets may indicate a shift towards risk aversion, which could lead to decreased investor confidence in tech stocks like NVDA, leading to a decline in its stock price.

3. **Competition from Analog Devices**: As mentioned in the article "Better Buy: NVIDIA vs. Analog Devices", Analog Devices has struggled to compete with NVIDIA's graphics processing units (GPUs), which may impact NVDA's stock performance.

4. **Intel's declining gross margin**: Intel's declining gross margin due to increased production costs could have a negative impact on NVDA, as it would imply that the tech sector is facing increasing competition and pressure.

5. **Bitcoin mining's declining profitability**: The article "3 Costs Cryptocurrency Miners Need to Know, and the 1 Wildcard That Can Change Everything" suggests that mining virtual currencies may not be as lucrative as previously thought, which could lead to decreased demand for NVDA's hardware components used in cryptocurrency mining.

Note: These factors may not necessarily affect NVDA's stock price immediately, but they could have a long-term impact on the company's growth and profitability.
