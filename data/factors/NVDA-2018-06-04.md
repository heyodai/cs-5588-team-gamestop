The recent success of games such as Fortnite and Apex Legends has contributed to NVIDIA's growth.
3. **Cloud Computing and Datacenter Sales**: The increasing adoption of cloud computing and datacenter technologies by businesses and governments may lead to increased demand for NVIDIA's GPUs and other hardware products, positively impacting the company's revenue and stock price.
