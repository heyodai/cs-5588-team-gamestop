Based on the provided news articles, here are the top 5 factors that may affect the stock price of NVDA (NVIDIA Corporation):

1. **Trade War Fears**: The trade war between the US and China has led to a decline in chip stocks, including those related to the tech sector. As tensions escalate, investors may become more cautious about investing in tech companies, which could negatively impact NVDA's stock price.
2. **Volatility in the Tech Sector**: The highflying technology sector has seen recent losses, with shares of tech companies like Micron Technology (MU) and social media giants Twitter (TWTR) and Facebook (FB). This volatility could lead to a decline in investor confidence, which could negatively impact NVDA's stock price.
3. **Trade War Impact on Semiconductor Stocks**: The trade war has led to a significant decline in the PHLX Semiconductor Sector index, with many semiconductor stocks experiencing losses. As a leading player in the tech sector, NVDA may be affected by this decline in its stock price.
4. **Earnings Surprises and Consensus Estimates**: NVIDIA Corporation has consistently beaten earnings expectations, which is reflected in its strong growth story. However, if the company's performance were to slow down or miss estimates, it could negatively impact investor confidence and lead to a decline in NVDA's stock price.
5. **Competition from Ambarella Inc.**: The article mentions Ambarella Inc. as a competitor to NVIDIA Corporation in the semiconductor industry. If Ambarella's performance improves and it gains traction in the market, it could potentially erode some of NVDA's market share and lead to a decline in its stock price.
