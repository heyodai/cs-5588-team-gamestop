Based on the news articles, the top 5 factors that may affect the stock price of NVDA (Nvidia) are:

1. **Rumors of a new gaming GPU launch**: The anticipation of a new GeForce GPU line, which is expected to be launched in Q3 or Q4 2018, has led to significant gains in the stock price, with shares surging 2.49% on Thursday.
2. **Trade war and tariffs**: Although the initial tariffs imposed by the US and China have had little impact on the market overall, some analysts are warning that a second set of tariffs, which could target NVDA's chip supplies to China, could lead to significant losses for the company.
3. **Pent-up demand for 4K gaming**: The lack of new GeForce GPUs in two years has led to pent-up demand for the new family of GPUs, which is expected to fuel the 4K gaming craze.
4. **Robust growth and international expansion**: Twitter's upgrade to a top Zacks Rank on solid international growth and NVDA's potential to benefit from this growth could lead to increased investor confidence in the company.
5. **Competition in the tech sector**: The technology sector is highly competitive, and NVDA faces competition from other companies, such as Sony and Sierra Wireless Inc., which may impact its stock price.

Note that these are not necessarily predictions of future events, but rather factors that could influence the stock price of NVDA based on current market sentiment and news.
