Based on the news, here are the top 5 factors that may affect the stock price of NVDA (NVIDIA):

1. **Self-driving taxis in California**: As part of Daimler's test program, NVIDIA's AI technology will power a fleet of autonomous taxis in California's Silicon Valley region, which could lead to increased demand for NVIDIA's Drive software and hardware solutions.
2. **Investments in high-end markets**: AMD's shift towards high-end processor markets may impact its operating margin, but NVIDIA's focus on the same market with its GPUs and Tegra processors could potentially drive up NVDA's stock price.
3. **Emerging markets growth**: Intel's struggle to compete in emerging markets like AI, automotive, and 5G could lead to increased demand for its rivals, including NVIDIA, which is already gaining traction in these areas.
4. **Data-center demand growth**: The growing demand for data centers is driving up the sales of semiconductor companies like AMD and NVIDIA. This trend could continue to support NVDA's stock price.
5. **Investor sentiment and trends**: The overall positive sentiment towards tech stocks, driven by strong tailwinds from emerging trends like gaming and artificial intelligence, may lead to increased investor confidence in NVDA's stock, driving up its price.

Note that these factors are not mutually exclusive, and their impact on NVDA's stock price could be interconnected.
