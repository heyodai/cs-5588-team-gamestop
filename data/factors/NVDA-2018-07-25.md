Here are the top 5 factors that may affect the stock price of NVDA based on the news:

1. **Upcoming Turing GeForce GTX Series 11 GPU**: The latest rumor about Nvidia's upcoming GPU series has been priced into the market, but some analysts may still be optimistic about its potential impact on sales and profitability.
2. **Collaboration with Darpa**: The partnership between Nvidia and Darpa for a four-year contract worth $23 million could lead to increased government spending on AI-powered technologies, which could positively impact NVDA's stock price.
3. **Expansion into AI Space with Google Cloud Partnership**: The integration of Tesla P4 GPUs into Google Cloud services could drive up demand for NVDA's products in the AI space, potentially leading to higher sales and revenue growth.
4. **Moore's Law End**: As Moore's law is expected to end, Nvidia may need to shift its focus towards new technologies and business models, which could impact its stock price if not executed successfully.
5. **Competition from TSMC in Crypto Mining**: Weak crypto demand in the short term, as reported by TSMC, could lead to increased competition for NVDA in the cryptocurrency mining space, potentially affecting its stock price.

Note that these factors may have both positive and negative impacts on NVDA's stock price, depending on how well Nvidia executes its strategies and adapts to changing market conditions.
