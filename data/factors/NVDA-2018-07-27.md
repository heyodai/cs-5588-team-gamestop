Based on the news article, here are the top 5 factors that may affect the stock price of NVDA (NVIDIA Corporation):

1. **Technical Resistance Level**: NVIDIA's stock is approaching a technical resistance level near $260.50, which could trigger a breakout and lead to a rise in stock price.
2. **Autonomous-Driving Technology**: NVIDIA's strong position in autonomous-driving technology, as demonstrated by its partnership with Daimler, could drive up demand for the company's automotive chips and increase its stock price.
3. **Competition from AMD**: The recent earnings beat of Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) has shown that AMD is gaining strength in categories where NVIDIA traditionally had a strong presence, which may put pressure on NVDA's stock price.
4. **Intel's Delayed 10-Nanometer Chip Technology**: Intel's delayed release of its new 10-nanometer chip technology could lead to increased demand for NVIDIA's chips and increase the company's stock price.
5. **Gross Margin Improvement**: Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC)'s guidance on gross margin improvement may have implications for the broader semiconductor industry, including NVDA, as it suggests a positive outlook for margins in the sector.

Note that these factors are not exhaustive, and other market conditions and events may also affect the stock price of NVDA.
