Based on the provided news articles, the top 5 factors that may affect the stock price of NVDA (NVIDIA) are:

1. **Launch of next-generation gaming GPU**: Rumors about a new gaming GPU from NVIDIA, which could potentially revive demand and boost sales. A launch date has been delayed to the end of August, but it's still expected to have a significant impact on the company's stock price.

2. **Gaming segment growth**: NVIDIA's gaming segment is its biggest growth driver, making up 56.5% of the company's revenue. Any positive developments or announcements in this area could positively affect NVDA's stock price.

3. **Anticipation and expectations from analysts**: Analysts are bullish on NVIDIA due to anticipation of new GPU technology, which has led to an increase in the ETF Channel's implied analyst target price for NVDA. This increased optimism can contribute to a positive stock price movement.

4. **GPU demand slowdown**: With GPU demand slowing, any news or rumors about a new generation of GPUs could lead to a shift in investor sentiment and potentially impact NVDA's stock price.

5. **Chipotle (CMG) health issues affecting the broader market**: Although not directly related to NVDA, health issues at Chipotle have led to a decline in CMG stock, which can have a ripple effect on other stocks in the same industry or with similar sector exposure, including NVIDIA.

Note that these factors are speculative and may not necessarily affect NVDA's stock price.
