2. **Trade war uncertainty and tariffs**: The Trump administration's threat of increasing tariffs to 25% on $200 billion worth of goods may lead to increased volatility in the market, particularly affecting industries such as technology and industrials.
3. **Autonomous driving advancements**: Tesla's progress in autonomous driving technology, including its self-driving chip, could impact NVDA's market share and revenue if other companies, like Tesla, decide to invest more in their own self-driving capabilities.
4. **Market sentiment and correction**: The article suggests that lower highs and overly-bullish sentiment may lead to a market correction, which could negatively affect the stock price of NVDA.
5. **Competition from AMD**: Although not explicitly stated as a direct impact on NVDA's stock price, the article mentions Intel's unexciting Q2 earnings and AMD's potential as a safer bet in the CPU segment, which may lead to increased competition for NVDA in the broader semiconductor market.
