Based on the news articles provided, here are the top 5 factors that may affect the stock price of NVDA (NVIDIA):

1. **Strong demand for Turing GPUs**: NVIDIA's recent stock rally appears to be partly related to the launch of its new Turing GPU products. However, Instinet analyst Romit Shah notes that while there is excitement around Turing, it has also received "mixed feedback" from tech press and NVIDIA's core user base due to concerns over pricing and performance.

2. **Phasing out of cryptocurrency revenue**: NVIDIA is facing uncertainty around phasing out its cryptocurrency revenue, which could impact the company's gaming revenues. This uncertainty may affect investor sentiment and stock price.

3. **Competition in the gaming industry**: The gaming industry is facing tough comps (comparisons) in the second half of 2018, and NVIDIA needs strong demand for Turing to overcome this. If the company fails to meet these expectations, it could negatively impact its stock price.

4. **Broadcom's cash flows and balance sheet structure**: Broadcom's strong cash flows and balance sheet structure may be a positive factor for investors, as they suggest the company has the financial resources to reward shareholders with dividends and share buybacks.

5. **Inflows in iShares Russell 1000 Growth ETF (IWF)**: The IWF has detected an approximate $183.8 million inflow, representing a 0.4% increase week over week. This could be a positive factor for NVIDIA's stock price if it is seen as a sign of growing investor confidence in the company.

Note that these factors are not mutually exclusive, and their impact on NVDA's stock price may interact with each other in complex ways.
