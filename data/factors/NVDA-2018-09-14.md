Here are the top 5 factors that may affect the stock price of NVDA (Nvidia):

1. **Dominance in machine learning**: Needham analyst Rajvindra Gill's new price target of $350, up from $325, implies 29% upside over the next 12 months. NVDA's leadership in artificial intelligence hardware and software makes it uniquely positioned to usher in the next wave of computing.

2. **Increased confidence on growth**: The analyst raised his estimates for Nvidia's fiscal year 2020 earnings based on increased confidence that the company will begin to take a larger share of the inference market with its new TensorRT Hyperscaler Platform.

3. **Artificial intelligence (AI) growth potential**: NVDA's strength in AI is expected to drive future growth, and investors are optimistic about the company's ability to capitalize on this trend.

4. **Investment in data center business**: Nvidia's data center business could be even more explosive than previously thought, with the analyst raising his price target on the stock due to increased confidence in its growth potential.

5. **Competition from other tech companies**: While NVDA is expected to continue its dominance in machine learning and AI, competition from other tech companies such as Micron and KLA-Tencor could potentially impact its growth prospects.
