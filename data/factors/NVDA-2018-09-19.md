Based on the news articles, here are the top 5 factors that may affect the stock price of NVDA:

1. **Rivalry with Intel**: NVDA's success in the desktop market against Intel (INTC) is a significant factor contributing to its growth. The company's new product lineup and competitive pricing strategy have been successful in beating Intel, which could lead to increased investor confidence.
2. **New GPU Releases and Reviews**: The recent release of Nvidia's high-end gaming GPUs, including the RTX 2080 and RTX 2080 Ti, has received positive reviews from reviewers. This could indicate a strong demand for these new GPUs, which could drive up NVDA's stock price.
3. **Growing Demand for Graphics Cards**: The growing demand for graphics cards in the gaming market is expected to continue, driven by the increasing popularity of PC gaming and the adoption of Nvidia's latest technologies.
4. **Partnership with Google**: NVDA's partnership with Google (GOOGL) to deploy Android operating systems in cars manufactured by Renault Nissan and Mitsubishi could lead to increased adoption and usage of Android, potentially driving up demand for NVDA's products.
5. **Growth in IoT and AI at the Edge**: Micron Technology's (MU) focus on the data economy, including innovation in IoT (Internet of Things) and AI at the edge, may have a positive impact on NVDA's stock price if it leads to increased adoption of its products in these areas.

Note that these factors are not necessarily unique to NVDA, but they are relevant to the company's growth prospects.
