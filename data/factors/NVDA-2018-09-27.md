Based on the news articles provided, here are the top 5 factors that may affect the stock price of NVDA (Nvidia Corporation):

1. **Tariffs**: The imposition of tariffs on Chinese goods affects graphics cards assembled in the Asian country, which may lead to higher prices for PC graphics cards and potentially impact Nvidia's gaming segment.
2. **Interest Rate Hikes**: The Federal Reserve's interest rate hikes may negatively impact Nvidia's stock price, as higher interest rates can reduce consumer spending and economic growth, which could be detrimental to Nvidia's semiconductor business.
3. **Competition from AMD**: Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) has been gaining traction in the chip market, and investors may start to sell NVDA shares if they perceive AMD as a more attractive alternative.
4. **Volatility in the Options Market**: Implied volatility surging for NVIDIA stock options suggests that investors are becoming increasingly nervous about the company's future performance, which could lead to selling pressure on the stock.
5. **Global Economic Uncertainty**: The ongoing trade tensions and economic uncertainty, particularly with regards to China, may impact Nvidia's supply chain and sales, leading to a decline in its stock price.
