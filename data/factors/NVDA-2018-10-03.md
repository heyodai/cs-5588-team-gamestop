Based on the provided news, here are the top 5 factors that may affect the stock price of NVDA (NVIDIA):

1. **Supply chain constraints and Intel's CPU shortage**: A shortage in Intel's CPUs due to supply issues could lead to a surge in demand for AMD's products, benefiting NVIDIA's business.
2. **Autonomous driving technology**: NVIDIA is well-positioned to benefit from the growing autonomous driving market, as it has already partnered with companies like Cruise Automation and General Motors.
3. **Gaming and graphics processing units (GPUs)**: NVIDIA's dominance in the gaming and GPU markets could continue to drive its stock price up, especially if the company continues to innovate and improve its products.
4. **Artificial intelligence (AI) and deep learning**: As AI and deep learning technologies become more prevalent, NVIDIA's Tegra Xavier processor and other AI-related products are likely to gain traction, driving demand for NVDA shares.
5. **Moody's upgrades**: Moody's has upgraded NVIDIA's credit rating to Ba3, indicating a positive outlook for the company's financial health and potentially leading to increased investor confidence and higher stock prices.

These factors may contribute to a strong upward trend in NVDA's stock price, but it's essential to note that market conditions and global economic uncertainty can always impact individual stocks.
