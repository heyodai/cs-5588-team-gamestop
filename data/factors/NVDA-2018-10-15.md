Based on the news articles provided, here are the top 5 factors that may affect the stock price of NVDA (NVIDIA):

1. **AI and Machine Learning Market Trends**: NVIDIA's efforts in artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning are gathering momentum due to its initiatives and adoption by key companies. This improving fundamental backdrop may lead to increased demand for NVIDIA's products, potentially driving up its stock price.

2. **Intel Competition and Market Shifts**: As Intel transitions to the data-centric business, it is expected to improve profits, which could impact NVIDIA's market share in the AI, server, and gaming PC CPU markets. If NVIDIA fails to keep pace with Intel's product leadership in these areas, its stock price may suffer.

3. **SoftBank Vision Fund's Investment**: As a major investor in NVIDIA, SoftBank Vision Fund's investment is expected to have a positive impact on the company's stock price. However, if SoftBank faces negative publicity due to the Saudi Arabian government controversy, it could lead to a decline in NVIDIA's stock price.

4. **Jim Cramer's Recommendation**: Jim Cramer has stated that NVIDIA is "going to miss the quarter" and that his charitable trust recently dumped the stock. This negative prediction may lead to increased selling pressure on NVIDIA's shares, potentially affecting its stock price.

5. **High Volatility in the Technology Market**: Micron Technology (MU) has experienced high volatility since June, which could also impact NVIDIA's stock price due to market-wide trends and competition in the semiconductor industry.
