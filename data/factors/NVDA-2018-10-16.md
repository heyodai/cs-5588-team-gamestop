Based on the provided news articles, here are the top 5 factors that may affect the stock price of NVDA (NVIDIA):

1. **Technical Damage from Recent Decline**: The October decline in NVDA's price has caused technical damage, which may impact the stock's short-term performance.
2. **Increased Selling Pressure**: The daily On-Balance-Volume (OBV) line has weakened this month, indicating that sellers have been more aggressive, which could lead to further downward pressure on the stock.
3. **Outright Sell Signal from MACD Oscillator**: The trend-following Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) oscillator has moved below the zero line for an outright sell signal, suggesting a potential short-term decline in NVDA's stock price.
4. **Competition from Peer Stocks**: Intel's struggling stock and peers' better top-line and bottom-line growth rates may have contributed to NVDA's decline, as investors may be reassessing the company's competitive position.
5. **Earnings Release and Market Sentiment**: The upcoming earnings release for Netflix (NFLX) and potential market volatility could impact NVDA's stock price, as well as the overall market sentiment, which has been cautious in recent days.

These factors suggest that NVDA's short-term performance may be affected by technical and fundamental issues, including increased selling pressure, a sell signal from the MACD oscillator, and competition from peer stocks.
