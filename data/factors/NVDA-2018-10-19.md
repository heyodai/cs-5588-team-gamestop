Based on the news article provided, here are the top 5 factors that may affect the stock price of NVDA (NVIDIA):

1. **Industry outlook and trend**: The autonomous driving revolution is gaining momentum, which could lead to increased demand for NVIDIA's products and services. However, if the industry slows down or faces significant challenges, it could negatively impact NVDA's stock price.

2. **Chip sector outlook**: As mentioned in the article, Goldman Sachs has been bearish on chip stocks, including NVDA. This negative sentiment from a reputable analyst firm could lead to decreased investor confidence and lower stock prices.

3. **Valuation ratios**: The article mentions that Intel's valuation ratio is 4.0x, which is lower than AMD's and significantly lower than NVIDIA's 12.6x. If investors perceive NVDA as overvalued compared to its peers, it could lead to decreased demand for the stock and lower prices.

4. **Sales growth expectations**: Analysts expect Intel's sales to rise 10.8% YoY in 2018, which may be seen as a positive sign for the chip industry. However, if NVDA's own sales growth does not meet or exceed these expectations, it could negatively impact its stock price.

5. **Dip buying opportunities**: The article suggests that the recent weakness in NVDA's stock presents an opportunity for tech investors to buy the dip at a discount price. If investors are able to identify and capitalize on these dips, they may be able to increase their holdings or gain a higher return on investment.
