4. **US-China Trade War**: The article mentions that generic chipmakers such as Texas Instruments (TXN) and Microchip Technology (MCHP) have started to feel the pinch of the US-China trade war, and this could also affect Nvidia's stock price.
5. **New Compute Workload Acceleration Trends**: JPMorgan analyst Harlan Sur noted that investors are underestimating secular gaming trends, as more than 30 new titles are set to be released in the next two quarters, and e-sports continue to gain popularity, which may benefit NVDA's stock price.
