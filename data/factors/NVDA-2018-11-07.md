Based on the provided news articles, here are the top 5 factors that may affect the stock price of NVDA:

1. **CEO Pay**: The article "Does NVIDIA Corporationâ€™s (NASDAQ:NVDA) CEO Pay Matter?" highlights the significant compensation package of Jensen Huang, NVIDIA's CEO, which may impact investor sentiment and potentially lead to a decrease in the company's stock price if investors perceive it as excessive.

2. **GPU Problems and Failures**: The rumors surrounding NVIDIA's upcoming GPUs, particularly the RTX 2080 Ti, have led to reports of problems with early adopters' systems. If these issues persist or are not adequately addressed by NVIDIA, it may negatively impact investor confidence and lead to a decline in the stock price.

3. **Self-driving Car Curriculum**: While the Nvidia Foundation's efforts to support research and education may be seen as a positive development, the specific mention of an innovative self-driving car curriculum could potentially raise concerns about the company's focus on emerging technologies, which may impact investor sentiment if not aligned with their expectations.

4. **Volunteer Hours and Community Impact**: The article highlights NVIDIA's community impact initiatives, including the donation of $4.4 million and coordination of 9,000 volunteer hours. While this can be seen as a positive for the company's reputation, it may also raise questions about the allocation of resources and potential dilution of investor returns.

5. **Competitive Landscape and Market Trends**: Although not explicitly mentioned in the articles, the fact that NVIDIA is launching new GPUs in an increasingly competitive market could potentially impact its stock price. If the launch is seen as a response to competition or if the market trends are unfavorable, it may lead to a decrease in investor confidence and subsequently affect the stock price.

Please note that these factors are speculative and based on the limited information provided by the news articles. A more comprehensive analysis would require additional data and context.
