Based on the news articles, here are the top 5 factors that may affect the stock price of NVDA:

1. **Growing demand from data centers**: NVIDIA's data center opportunity remains strong despite growing competition as secular AI demand expands its GPUs (graphics processing unit). This growth driver is expected to drive the company's revenue and profits.
2. **Autonomous vehicle (AV) market growth**: The AV market is being developed in five levels, with level 5 being self-driving cars. NVIDIA's involvement in this space is expected to drive further growth for the company.
3. **Competition from AMD in GPUs**: While NVIDIA faces competition from Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) in GPUs, AMD has not been able to match NVIDIA's profit margins. This could lead to a competitive advantage for NVIDIA in the long run.
4. **Diversification of revenue streams**: With the growth of the AV market and data centers, NVIDIA is diversifying its revenue streams beyond traditional gaming. This shift towards new markets can help reduce dependence on specific industries and increase overall stability.
5. **Inference opportunity expansion**: NVIDIA's inference opportunity has expanded its total addressable data center market from $30 billion by 2023 to $50 billion by 2023. This growth driver is expected to drive further revenue and profit growth for the company.

Note that these factors may have varying degrees of impact on NVDA's stock price, and the actual effect may depend on various market and economic conditions.
