Based on the text, it appears that NVIDIA's (NVDA) stock has been negatively impacted by several factors:

1. Disappointing Q3 earnings: NVDA reported lower-than-expected revenue and earnings per share, which led to a 16.77% decline in after-hours trading.
2. Weaker demand for cryptocurrency mining: The decline in cryptocurrency prices has resulted in reduced demand for NVIDIA's graphics cards used in mining rigs.
3. Inventory buildup: The company's inventory of Pascal-GPU-based graphics cards is piling up due to the weak demand, which could lead to a further decline in sales and revenue.

Additionally, some analysts are warning that NVDA may be experiencing a shift in the industry, with chipmakers becoming more cautious about order growth due to macro uncertainty.
