Here are the top 5 factors that may affect the stock price of NVDA:

1. **Machine Learning Chip Competition**: Amazon's launch of its machine learning chip, Inferentia, may impact NVIDIA's (NVDA) dominance in this space. The competition could lead to decreased demand for NVIDIA's GPUs and other related products.
2. **GPU Pricing Rebound**: Mizuho analyst Vijay Rakesh's report on a potential rebound in GPU prices could positively impact NVIDIA's stock price. However, if the rebound is slower than expected or is not sustained, it could have a negative impact.
3. **Crypto Hangover and Earnings Report**: NVIDIA's recent earnings report mentioned a "crypto hangover" which had impacted its stock price. If investors are still concerned about the lingering effects of cryptocurrency on NVIDIA's business, it could lead to decreased demand for its products.
4. **Analyst Price Target Cuts**: The decrease in analyst price targets for NVIDIA from $300 to $245 may indicate a more pessimistic outlook for the company's future performance. This could lead to a decrease in investor confidence and a negative impact on NVDA's stock price.
5. **Global Economic Uncertainty**: The recent decline of the S&P 500 index and other global economic indicators suggest that investors are becoming increasingly cautious about the economy. If this trend continues, it could lead to decreased demand for NVIDIA's products and a negative impact on its stock price.
