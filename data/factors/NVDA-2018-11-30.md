2. **Decline in Semiconductor Stocks**: The decline in shares of high-flying semiconductor companies like Advanced Micro Devices Inc., Micron Technology Inc., and Nvidia Corp. over the past two months may lead to a broader market downturn if the trend continues.
3. **Disappointing Financial Guidance**: NVDA's recent disappointing financial guidance, citing a glut of mid-range graphics processors in the channel, may impact investor confidence and lead to a decline in its stock price.
4. **Competition from Mid-Range Graphics Processors**: The increasing competition from mid-range graphics processors in the market may affect NVDA's pricing power and profit margins, leading to a decline in its stock price.
