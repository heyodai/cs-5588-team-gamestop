Here are some key points to take away from the article:

1. **NVIDIA's growth story is showing cracks**: The stock has lost nearly 50% of its value in less than three months due to a decline in demand for its GPUs.
2. **Citi adds NVDA to "Semis Christmas Shopping list"**: Citigroup has added NVIDIA to its list of semiconductor stocks that are expected to carve out a price floor after the recent sell-off.
3. **Analyst Atif Malik sees an attractive entry point**: Malik believes that the current price is a good entry point for investors looking to buy high-quality companies in the semiconductor space.
4. **NVDA's stock has lagged the market lately**: The stock has closed at $148.90, moving 0.48% from the previous trading session, which lags behind the S&P 500's gain of 0.54%.

Overall, it seems that while NVIDIA's growth story is facing some challenges, there may still be opportunities for investors to buy into the stock at a lower price point.
