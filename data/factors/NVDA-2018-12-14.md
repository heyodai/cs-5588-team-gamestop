1. **Market share and competitive edge**: The article mentions that the launch of new graphics cards will help AMD increase its market share and give it a competitive edge against peers.
2. **China's growing pain**: China's industrial output and retail sales growth data for November came in below market expectations, which may impact the global tech industry, including AMD.
3. **Trade dispute and tariffs**: The article mentions that Apple is losing investors' confidence due to weak new iPhone sales and tariffs in the fourth quarter, but it does not mention NVDA or AMD directly.
4. **Market trends and recession concerns**: Some articles mention that part of the Treasury yield curve has inverted, which may indicate a looming recession. This could impact the tech industry, including AMD.

Unfortunately, there is no direct information about NVDA in these news articles. However, based on general market trends and industry developments, here are some potential factors that may affect NVIDIA's stock price:

1. **Global demand for graphics cards**: The launch of new graphics cards by AMD could impact the global demand for GPUs, which may affect NVIDIA's stock price.
2. **Trade disputes and tariffs**: Global trade tensions and tariffs may impact the supply chain and pricing of NVIDIA's products, including its GPUs.
3. **Market trends and recession concerns**: As mentioned earlier, a potential recession may impact the tech industry, including NVIDIA.
