Unfortunately, the provided text does not mention NVDA (NVIDIA) stock price or its factors affecting it. However, based on the news articles, here are some general factors that may affect the stock price of similar companies in the technology sector:

1. **Supply and demand imbalance**: Imbalances in supply and demand can significantly impact stock prices. In the case of memory chipmakers like Micron (MU), a decline in supply and an increase in demand can lead to higher stock prices.

2. **Economic trends and market sentiment**: Economic downturns, trade wars, and changes in investor sentiment can all impact technology stocks, including those in the graphics processing unit (GPU) segment like NVIDIA.

3. **Trends in emerging technologies**: Advancements and adoption of emerging technologies, such as artificial intelligence (AI), blockchain, or cryptocurrencies, can create new opportunities for growth and increase investor interest in related stocks.

4. **Regulatory changes**: Changes in regulations or policies can impact the market value of technology companies, particularly those involved in sensitive areas like AI, data privacy, or cybersecurity.

5. **Competition and market share**: The level of competition in a particular market segment can affect stock prices, with companies that maintain their market share often seeing higher stock prices than those that struggle to compete.

Note that these factors are general and may not specifically apply to NVIDIA's stock price or its factors affecting it, as the provided text does not mention NVDA.
