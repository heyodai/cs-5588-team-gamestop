Based on the provided news articles, here are the top 5 factors that may affect the stock price of NVDA (NVIDIA):

1. **Weakening iPhone sales**: Apple's struggles with weakening iPhone sales and its legal battles with Qualcomm could negatively impact NVIDIA, which is a major supplier to Apple for its graphics processing units (GPUs).
2. **Oversold conditions**: NVIDIA's Relative Strength Index (RSI) has fallen into oversold territory, indicating that the stock may be due for a bounce-back. This could lead to increased investor interest and buying pressure.
3. **Cryptocurrency market volatility**: The cryptocurrency market's recent downturn, which affected NVIDIA's stock price, could continue to impact the company's performance. A recovery in the cryptocurrency market could boost NVIDIA's stock price.
4. **Fed's rate hike and comments**: The Federal Reserve's decision to raise interest rates and its reduced expectations for 2019 hikes may have caused a sell-off in the US market, including stocks like NVIDIA.
5. **Competition from AMD**: Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) has taken a beating in recent months, but some analysts remain bullish on its prospects. This increased competition could impact NVIDIA's stock price, particularly if AMD is able to gain significant market share in the semiconductor industry.

These factors may contribute to NVIDIA's stock price fluctuations, but it's essential to conduct thorough research and consider multiple perspectives before making any investment decisions.
