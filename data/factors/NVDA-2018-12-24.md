Here are the top 5 factors that may affect the stock price of NVDA:

1. **Class Action Lawsuit**: A class action lawsuit has been filed against NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA) by the Schall Law Firm, alleging violations of federal securities laws under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. The lawsuit seeks to recover damages for alleged misstatements made by the company between August 10, 2017, and November 15, 2018.

2. **Soft Demand for Phones and Computers**: Micron Technology (MU), a major supplier of memory chips to smartphones and computers, is struggling with an oversupply of DRAM and NAND memory chips due to weak demand in the smartphone and PC markets. This has led to a fall in chip prices, affecting NVIDIA's revenue.

3. **Market Correction**: The end of 2018 saw a significant correction in the market, with all major indexes falling. The NASDAQ even slipped briefly into bear market territory. This correction may impact investor sentiment and affect NVDA's stock price.

4. **Pricing Multiple**: NVIDIA Corp.'s price-earnings multiple has fallen to its lowest level in seven years, with a 55% drop in the last quarter alone. Analysts are shaking their heads over this significant decline, which could lead to a reevaluation of the company's valuation and potentially impact its stock price.

5. **Oversupply of Memory Chips**: The oversupply of DRAM and NAND memory chips has led to lower chip prices, affecting Micron Technology (MU) and other memory chip suppliers. This market glut may continue to pressure NVDA's revenue and profitability, impacting its stock price.

These factors highlight the potential risks and challenges facing NVIDIA Corporation's stock price in the near term.
