Based on the news articles, here are the top 5 factors that may affect the stock price of NVDA (NVIDIA Corporation):

1. **Class-Action Lawsuit**: Investors claim NVIDIA was not forthcoming about its crypto-mining business, leading to a potential class-action lawsuit. This could impact investor confidence and lead to a decline in stock price.
2. **Distribution Channel Issues**: NVIDIA's financial forecast missed analyst and investor expectations due to issues with distribution channels being filled with products, which may affect the company's ability to meet demand and potentially lower sales.
3. **Crypto Collapse**: The collapse of the crypto market may have affected NVIDIA's business, particularly its crypto-mining segment, leading to a decline in stock price.
4. **Competition from AMD**: Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) is expected to gain ground in the GPU market, which could lead to increased competition and pressure on NVIDIA's stock price.
5. **Data Center Graphics Cards**: NVIDIA's prospects for success in data center graphics cards are promising, but this development may also affect the company's overall performance and potentially impact its stock price.

Note that these factors may not be directly related to each other, and their individual impacts on NVDA's stock price can vary depending on various market and economic conditions.
