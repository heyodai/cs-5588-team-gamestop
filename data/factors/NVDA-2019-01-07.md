The article discusses Apple's recent guidance on revenues and gross margins for its last quarter. Here are the key points:

1. **Revenue Guidance**: Apple has revised its revenue guidance downward, now expecting $89 billion to $93 billion in revenues for the last quarter, down from the previous estimate of $95 billion to $105 billion.
2. **Gross Margin**: The company expects gross margins to be around 38% for the last quarter, slightly lower than the previous guidance of 38% to 38.5%.
3. **Reasons for Revision**: Apple's CEO Tim Cook cited several reasons for the revised guidance, including:
	* A slowdown in the Chinese economy, which has impacted iPhone sales.
	* The US-China trade war, which has also affected iPhone sales.
	* The rising value of the US dollar against key currencies, which is expected to act as a headwind to revenues.
4. **Internal Factors**: Cook also mentioned internal factors, such as the timing of new iPhone launches and other new Apple products, as contributing to the revised guidance.
5. **Stock Price Impact**: The negative news triggered a massive sell-off of 10.0% in Apple stock on January 3, but a sharp recovery of 4.3% on January 4 was driven by macro factors.

Overall, it seems that Apple is facing challenges in its global market, including the slowdown in China and the impact of trade tensions with China. However, internal factors, such as new product launches, may also be contributing to the revised guidance.
