The article discusses the current valuation of NVIDIA (NVDA) and whether it is a good time to buy the stock. The analyst notes that NVDA's valuation looks reasonable at around 20x earnings backed out by the company's net cash, but they are not convinced that there is a catalyst ahead for the stock to rise.

The analyst mentions several reasons why they are skeptical of NVDA's stock price:

1. Pricing pressure across the industry
2. Q4 numbers are likely to be disappointing
3. The chip space is depressed

However, the analyst also notes that NVIDIA has long-term growth potential and a relatively high multiple for a chip stock, which could make it a "show me" story.

The analyst suggests that some investors may see NVDA as a good buy due to its low valuation, but they personally think that the opportunity in NVDA will still be there for the first half of 2019 at least, and potentially at a lower price.

Overall, the article concludes that while NVDA's stock price may be reasonable now, it is not necessarily a good time to jump on the stock just yet.
