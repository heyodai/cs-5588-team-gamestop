This article discusses three big stock charts to watch for Friday:

1. **Merck (MRK)**: Merck is working towards a breaking point, but still has a rising support line that could push it over if another misstep occurs. The 100-day moving average line was broken yesterday, and massive spike in bearish volume on Thursday underscores the brewing selling interest.
2. **Advanced Micro Devices (AMD)**: AMD's shares have been stagnant since recovering from a key support level around $16 last year. The stock is now poised for a potential breakout thrust if it can get decent traction for just one more day. The ceiling in question is around $21, and traders have kept the stock at or above the 20-day, 50-day, and 200-day moving average lines.
3. **NVIDIA (NVDA)**: NVIDIA fell by 3.31% to trade at $152.61 on Friday due to a 3% drop in price. The company has been focusing on home robotics, and its "Level 2+ automated driving system" was recently introduced.

These charts suggest that investors should be cautious and keep an eye on these stocks as they navigate potential market fluctuations.
