* The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 318 points due to Caterpillar's disappointing results and other factors.
* Nvidia Corp. cut its revenue guidance for Q4 2019 by 12%, citing weak performance in gaming and datacenter businesses. This led to a sharp decline in the company's stock price.
* Other chip stocks, including Advanced Micro Devices (AMD), Intel Corp., and Micron Technology Inc., also fell after Nvidia's announcement.
