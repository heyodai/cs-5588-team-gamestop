The article discusses the current state of NVIDIA (NVDA) stock and whether it's a good time to buy. Here are some key points:

1. **Valuation**: NVDA's forward price-to-earnings ratio has dropped from 47.2 in 2017 to around 24.0 today, which is lower than its peer group's valuation.
2. **Guidance**: The company's Q4 earnings and guidance were mixed, causing a surprise rally in the stock price.
3. **Long-term investor perspective**: For long-term investors, NVDA's current valuation may not be a cause for panic, as the company is still growing rapidly and has a strong position in cutting-edge markets such as AI, AV, and cloud technology.
4. **Short-term trader perspective**: Short-term traders should keep an eye on Washington D.C. for any definitive trade war news, which could be a bullish or bearish catalyst for the stock.

Overall, the article suggests that NVDA's current valuation is not overly cheap, but it may still offer opportunities for long-term investors who are willing to hold onto the stock for years to come.
