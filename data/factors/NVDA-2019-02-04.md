The article discusses the recent earnings report of Western Digital (WDC), a leading manufacturer of hard disk drives and NAND flash memory. Despite beating analyst expectations, WDC's stock price fell due to weak guidance for future earnings. The company expects adjusted EPS of $0.40-$0.60 and a gross margin of 28% in the second half of the year, which is lower than the previous quarter.

However, some investors are optimistic about WDC's prospects, citing comments from CEO Steve Milligan on the Q2 conference call that growth will resume for the company in the second half of the year. Additionally, WDC has cut capacity in NAND to support pricing, similar to Micron (MU), which has rallied this year.

Despite WDC's potential for recovery, there are concerns about the cyclical nature of the memory business and the impact of data center slowdowns on demand. Analysts' expectations for future earnings may be too optimistic, and investors should consider other chip stocks that may offer better value at current prices.

The article concludes that it's too early to believe that WDC is out of the woods just yet, and investors should exercise caution when considering the stock.
