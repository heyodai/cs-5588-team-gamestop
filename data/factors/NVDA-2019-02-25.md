Based on the news articles provided, the top 5 factors that may affect the stock price of NVDA (NVIDIA) are:

1. **US-China Trade Deal**: A positive US-China trade deal could have a significant impact on NVIDIA's stock price, as the company has substantial exposure to China through its semiconductor manufacturing and sales business.

2. **Semiconductor Industry Trends**: The growth prospects for the AI space, as mentioned in Cowen's report, could positively affect NVDA's stock price due to its strong position in this area.

3. **Market Sentiment**: Changes in market sentiment, such as a shift from bearish to bullish views of the US-China trade situation or an increase in investor confidence in the semiconductor industry, may influence NVDA's stock price.

4. **Investor Confidence**: Warren Buffett's indirect statements about President Trump's claims being "beyond arrogance" and his investments in Berkshire Hathaway (BRK-B) may impact NVDA's stock price if investors perceive a shift in market sentiment or a change in investor confidence.

5. **Apple's Stock Price Performance**: Apple's (AAPL) stock performance, particularly its decline since Warren Buffett's decision to sell some of its shares, might affect NVDA's stock price due to the close relationship between the two companies and their shared exposure to the semiconductor market.

Note that these factors may not be directly related to NVIDIA's stock price, but rather provide context on potential market influences.
