Based on the provided news articles, here are the top 5 factors that may affect the stock price of NVDA:

1. **Cryptocurrency Bust**: The recent decline in cryptocurrency prices has taken a toll on NVIDIA's graphics cards business, as sales of discrete graphics cards have dropped.
2. **Inventory Levels**: According to Jon Peddie Research, there is too much inventory in retail, which can lead to decreased demand and subsequently affect NVIDIA's stock price.
3. **E-Sports Boom**: The growth of the e-sports industry could benefit NVIDIA's gaming business, as the company has recently introduced new graphics cards like the GeForce GTX 1660 Ti.
4. **Federal Reserve's Direction**: The Fed's alleged mistake of raising rates when economic conditions do not support it may have an impact on NVIDIA's stock price, as it may affect the overall market sentiment and consumer spending habits.
5. **Competition from AMD**: Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) is gaining ground in the graphics card market, which could potentially dent NVIDIA's market share and affect its stock price.

Note that these factors are not exhaustive and may have other underlying causes or effects on NVDA's stock price.
