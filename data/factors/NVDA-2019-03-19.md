**Micron Stock Outlook: Focusing on Memory Pricing**

Micron stock will continue to be driven by memory pricing, not quarterly earnings reports. The company is expected to remain profitable due to higher demand for memory chips in new technologies.

**Factors to Consider**

* Memory prices are currently unfavorable for Micron, which relies heavily on DRAM and NAND memory.
* Production cost reductions may help earnings, but they distract from the true picture of memory pricing trends.
* Investor focus should be on watching "memory prices" rather than production costs or quarterly reports.
* Despite lower profits through 2021, Micron's demand for memory chips is expected to keep the company profitable in leaner times.

**Investment Advice**

* Focus on other news and avoid getting distracted by production cost reductions.
* Keep an eye on memory pricing trends, as they will likely continue to impact Micron stock.
* Expect Micron stock to rise and fall with memory prices until market demand drives these prices higher.
