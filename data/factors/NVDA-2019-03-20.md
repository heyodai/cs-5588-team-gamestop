Here are three chip stocks to buy for the next three years:

1. **Nvidia (NVDA)**: As discussed earlier, Nvidia is a dominant player in multiple data-centric markets that have broad growth potential. The company has ample exposure to emerging markets like data centers, IoT, AI, automation, and AR/VR. With a 20x forward valuation, NVDA stock offers a reasonable entry point despite its strong growth prospects.
2. **Intel (INTC)**: While not as dominant as Nvidia in some areas, Intel is still a major player in the chip industry with exposure to multiple markets, including CPUs, GPUs, and chipsets. The company has been working on improving its manufacturing process and has made significant investments in emerging technologies like AI and IoT.
3. **Advanced Micro Devices (AMD)**: AMD has been gaining ground in recent years, particularly in the high-end gaming market with its Ryzen and Radeon lines. The company's EPYC server chips have also found success in data centers. With a strong pipeline of new products and a growing presence in emerging markets, AMD offers an attractive value proposition.

All three stocks have the potential to benefit from the growth in emerging technologies like AI, IoT, and automation over the next few years. However, it's essential to conduct thorough research and consider individual stock characteristics before making any investment decisions.
