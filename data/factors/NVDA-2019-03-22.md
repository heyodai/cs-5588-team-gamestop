Based on the article, it seems that NVDA stock (NVIDIA) is a good time to buy into the rally, as the company's long-term growth drivers remain healthy, and near-term headwinds are phasing out. The article highlights three secular growth markets for Nvidia: gaming, data centers, and autonomous driving. Additionally, the valuation of NVDA stock has decreased from 40-50 times forward earnings to 25 times, leaving room for upside.

The author suggests that Nvidia's long-term bull thesis is confirmed by the company's Investor Day, which revealed that excess channel inventory is on track to clear in Q1, and growth drivers remain healthy. The article also mentions that the company has an enormous $100 billion-plus opportunity in front of it, with projected revenues this year at just over $11 billion.

Overall, the article suggests that investors should consider buying NVDA stock as a long-term investment opportunity, given its strong growth prospects and decreasing valuation.
