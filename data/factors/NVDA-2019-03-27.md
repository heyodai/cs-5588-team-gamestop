Based on the provided text, it appears that AMD (Advanced Micro Devices) stock is being evaluated for its potential performance in the coming years. The author notes that AMD has had success recently, driven by its growth in GPUs and datacenter markets, but also expresses caution about the company's future prospects.

The author mentions that:

* AMD's recent gains are partially priced in, making it difficult to sustain further growth.
* The industry as a whole is uncertain, with questions surrounding datacenter and GPU demand.
* Alphabet (GOOG/GOOGL) has had success with its partnership with AMD, but the author argues that this may not be sustainable and that AMD will need to continue to grind out market share gains and gross margin expansion.

Overall, the author seems to be recommending caution when it comes to investing in AMD stock.
