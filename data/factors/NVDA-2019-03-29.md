The article discusses the potential risks facing Nvidia's stock, specifically in Q3 when its results are expected to normalize. The three key aspects of the outlook that could come under pressure are:

1. **Gaming sector**: Gaming stocks such as Activision Blizzard and Take-Two Interactive have declined sharply in recent months, suggesting slower-than-expected growth in the gaming sector.
2. **Datacenter segment**: The datacenter business drove significant revenue growth for Nvidia in FY19, but spending by customers has slowed dramatically in Q4, posing a risk to future growth.
3. **Misread of crypto craze**: Nvidia's management was criticized for over-promising on the crypto market last year, and investors may become more skeptical if the company underperforms again.

The article also notes that analysts are bearish on Nvidia's stock, with consensus estimates projecting a 5% decline in revenue this year. Investors who have been willing to trust Nvidia's guidance so far may need to be proven wrong if the company fails to deliver.

Overall, the article suggests that investors should approach Nvidia's stock with caution and consider the potential risks facing the company, particularly in Q3 when its results are expected to normalize.
