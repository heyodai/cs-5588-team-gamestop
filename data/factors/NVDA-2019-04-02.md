It appears that this is not a traditional stock analysis or recommendation article, but rather a collection of articles and news pieces from InvestorPlace about various stocks, including pet health company Elanco Animal Health (ELAN) and GPU manufacturer Intel (INTC).

If you're looking for investment advice or recommendations, I'd be happy to help with that. However, please note that I'm not a financial advisor, and my responses should not be considered personalized investment advice.

Here are some potential stocks mentioned in the articles:

1. Elanco Animal Health (ELAN) - a pet health company with a strong market presence.
2. Intuitive Surgical (ISRG) - a medical technology company with innovative robotic surgery systems.
3. Intel (INTC) - a semiconductor manufacturer with ambitions to enter the GPU market.

If you're considering investing in these stocks or others, I recommend doing your own research and consulting with a financial advisor to determine the best investment strategy for your individual circumstances.
