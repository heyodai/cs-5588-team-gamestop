Based on the provided news, here are the top 5 factors that may affect the stock price of NVDA (NVIDIA Corporation):

1. **Qualcomm's entry into AI accelerator market**: Qualcomm's unveiling of the Cloud AI 100 server accelerator card solution and three new Snapdragon system-on-chips (SoCs) could potentially impact NVIDIA's dominance in the AI acceleration market, leading to a decline in NVDA's stock price.
2. **Intel's Q1 earnings season**: As analysts downgrade Intel's ratings ahead of its Q1 earnings report, this may lead to a sell-off in the semiconductor sector, including NVIDIA's stock, due to concerns about weaker earnings growth and potential overvaluation.
3. **Semiconductor sector trends**: The semiconductor sector is expected to report its weakest earnings in two years, which could negatively impact NVDA's stock price if investors become cautious about the company's ability to grow earnings.
4. **NVIDIA's outperformance of the S&P 500**: NVIDIA's strong performance and outpacing of the S&P 500 gains may lead to increased investor confidence in the stock, potentially driving up its price.
5. **Low short interest**: With less than 5% of NVDA shares on loan, low short interest may indicate that investors are becoming increasingly bullish on the company, leading to increased buying pressure and potential upward momentum in the stock price.
