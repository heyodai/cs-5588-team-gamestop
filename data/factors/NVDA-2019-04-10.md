Based on the provided news articles, here are the top 5 factors that may affect the stock price of NVDA (NVIDIA Corporation):

1. **Data Center Market Competition**: As NVIDIA already dominates the data center chip market, competition from new entrants like Qualcomm (QCOM) and other established players may put pressure on NVDA's pricing power and market share.

2. **AI Inference Chips**: The growing demand for AI inference chips, particularly in edge computing and smaller data centers, could benefit companies like NVIDIA. However, if the market grows rapidly beyond expectations, it might lead to increased competition and price pressure on NVDA.

3. **Qualcomm's Entry into Data Center Market**: As mentioned earlier, Qualcomm's new Cloud AI 100 chip aims to take on established players like Nvidia and Intel in the data center chip market. This could potentially disrupt the status quo, affecting NVDA's revenue growth prospects.

4. **Market Share Shifts**: If NVIDIA loses market share to competitors or fails to capitalize on emerging trends in AI and edge computing, it may impact its stock price negatively.

5. **Earnings Growth Expectations**: As one of the top-performing semiconductor stocks, AMD (Advanced Micro Devices) is a key competitor to NVDA. Any concerns about AMD's earnings growth prospects or its ability to maintain market share could positively affect NVDA's stock price by increasing investor confidence in the company's relative performance.

Note that these factors are not exhaustive, and other market-specific events or news may also impact the stock prices of companies like NVIDIA Corporation.
