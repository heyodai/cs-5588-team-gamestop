Based on the provided news articles, here are the top 5 factors that may affect the stock price of NVDA (Nvidia):

1. **Autonomous Vehicle (ADAS) Segment Growth**: The development and adoption of Nvidia's ADAS systems in the automotive industry could drive significant revenue growth for the company. With estimated TAM of $30 billion and potential customers like Toyota, Mercedes Benz, and other automakers, this segment has the potential to offset negative headwinds from the gaming industry.

2. **Xavier Chip Adoption**: The adoption of Nvidia's Xavier chip in robotics and datacenter applications could lead to significant revenue growth for the company. With 85 other companies developing on the Xavier platform, this segment has a strong upside potential.

3. **Toysota Collaboration**: The collaboration between Toyota and Nvidia on autonomous vehicles could lead to increased demand for Nvidia's ADAS systems, potentially driving revenue growth for the company.

4. **Tesla's Autonomous Features**: Tesla's 77% attach rate for its advanced autonomous features could indicate that there is a potential for broader adoption of autonomous technology in the automotive industry, which could positively impact Nvidia's stock price.

5. **GPU Shipments Tied to Gaming and Crypto Mining**: The relative weakness of the gaming industry and the decline in GPU shipments tied to crypto mining could negatively impact Nvidia's stock price. However, if the company can offset this with growth from its ADAS segment, it could mitigate some of the negative impacts.
