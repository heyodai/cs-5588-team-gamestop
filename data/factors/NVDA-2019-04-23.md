Based on the provided text, here's a summary of the Intel stock analysis:

**Positive Points:**

1. Intel has declared a quarterly common stock dividend of 31.5 cents per share, with a yield of 2.15%.
2. The company has an active share repurchase program, indicating proactive management.
3. Intel is a well-established technology company with a history of delivering stable and growing dividends.

**Negative Points:**

2. Investors should be cautious about profit-taking or short-selling Intel shares due to potential industry or market fluctuations.
3. Short-term volatility and potential losses may occur if the company's competitors (e.g., AMD, QCOM, NVDA) release earnings that negatively impact Intel's share price.

**Recommendation:**

For long-term investors, considering investing in Intel stock as a buy candidate, with an expected reach of $70 by the end of 2020. However, for short-term traders or investors who want to hedge against potential losses, using a covered call strategy with a two-month time horizon might be a suitable option.
