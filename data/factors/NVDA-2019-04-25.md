Based on the article, here are some key points about Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) stock:

1. **Pent-up demand**: AMD needs to win a significant share of the tepid growth in data center spending to meet expectations for the second half of 2019.
2. **Server processor competition**: The company's server processors need to outperform Intel's offerings to gain an edge in the market.
3. **Consumer PC sales**: Sales have declined, and consumers may not be upgrading their machines as much as expected due to lack of new operating system from Microsoft.
4. **Revenue growth expectations**: AMD is expected to grow its revenue by nearly 21% next year, but this seems unrealistic given the current market conditions.
5. **Stock valuation**: AMD stock is already priced at 29.5 times next year's expected earnings, making it a high-risk investment.
6. **Caution advised**: Investors should exercise caution and wait to see how AMD performs in the second half of the year before making any decisions.

Overall, while AMD has been a strong performer in recent years, its growth prospects for 2019 are uncertain, and investors should be cautious when considering investing in the stock.
