The provided text discusses the current state of Western Digital Corporation (WDC) stock, which has been experiencing a dip. The bulls may consider WDC as a support level for this dip, with potential resistance at $38 per share if bears prevail.

However, it's essential to note that the same scenario occurred three years ago when WDC fell from $110 per share and bottomed behind strong support from the $45 point of interest zone. This suggests that if you're already long WDC stock, waiting out the current battle might be a good strategy.

Additionally, if WDC is spiking, it's likely that the entire sector will rise as well. Considering this, investing in Western Digital stock to catch the rally may not be the best option, and there are other stocks with better growth potential that could offer more attractive returns.

The text also mentions NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA), which has outpaced the S&P 500 gains over the past trading session. This indicates that NVDA is performing well and may be a good investment opportunity.
