Based on the provided news articles, here are the top 5 factors that may affect the stock price of NVDA (Nvidia):

1. **Competition from Tesla's new chip**: Tesla has developed its own chip for autonomous capabilities, which could potentially compete with Nvidia's products in the market.
2. **Loss of Tesla as a customer**: Tesla was one of Nvidia's major customers, but Elon Musk announced that Tesla would be developing its own chips. This could lead to a loss of revenue for Nvidia.
3. **Gaming and self-driving cars**: Nvidia continues to be a leader in gaming and self-driving cars, which could drive the demand for its products. However, the recent downturn in the chips market may affect its performance.
