Here are the top 5 factors that may affect the stock price of NVDA (NVIDIA):

1. **Autonomous Driving Technology**: NVIDIA's certification to test self-driving vehicles in the state of Washington, along with market frontrunners like Waymo, highlights its growing presence in autonomous driving technology. This could lead to increased demand for its GPUs and other products in the autonomous vehicle space.

2. **Trade Tensions**: The ongoing trade tensions between the US and China could impact NVIDIA's sales, particularly if the trade war escalates. If China increases tariffs on NVIDIA's products or imposes new restrictions, it could negatively affect the company's revenue and stock price.

3. **AMD Stock Performance**: As a competitor to AMD in graphics and other areas, NVIDIA's stock performance is closely tied to AMD's success. If AMD continues to gain market share, it could put pressure on NVIDIA's stock price.

4. **US-China Trade Talks**: The upcoming trade talks between the US and China are crucial for NVIDIA, as they could impact the company's sales and revenue. If the talks fail or if tariffs increase, it could negatively affect NVIDIA's stock price.

5. **Chips Industry Slowdown**: The slowdown in the chips industry, which is exacerbated by the trade war, could have a negative impact on NVIDIA's stock price. As a major player in the industry, NVIDIA's sales and revenue are closely tied to the overall health of the market.

Note that these factors are not exhaustive, and other news and events may also impact NVDA's stock price.
