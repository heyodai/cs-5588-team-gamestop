Based on the provided news, here are the top 5 factors that may affect the stock price of NVDA:

1. **Earnings expectations**: Analysts expect Nvidia to report a decline in earnings due to lower revenues, which could negatively impact the stock price.
2. **Semiconductor industry concerns**: The chip glut and uncertainty in the semiconductor industry may affect the stock price, despite Nvidia's strength in 2019.
3. **Trade negotiations**: Uncertainty involving U.S.-China trade negotiations is causing a large-scale market selloff, which may affect NVDA's stock price.
4. **Competition from Advanced Micro Devices (AMD)**: AMD has gained significant ground in the semiconductor industry, and its recent wins, such as powering the world's first AI platform for NHS hospitals, could impact NVDA's stock price.
