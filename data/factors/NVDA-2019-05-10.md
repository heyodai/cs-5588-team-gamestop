The article discusses the potential target price of NVIDIA (NVDA) stock, which has been downwardly revised by analysts in recent months. Despite this, some research houses, including Jefferies and UBS, have initiated coverage with bullish opinions and raised their price targets. The author notes that analysts tend to consistently extend a consensus target and lead a trend, often in the opposite direction of market sentiment.

Key points:

* NVDA stock has been downgraded six times since mid-November, with its consensus target reduced from $297 to $187.
* Jefferies, which had previously called NVDA a "franchise pick," lowered its target to $246 and then again to $185 in January.
* UBS recently initiated coverage with a bullish opinion and raised its price target to $210, citing data center opportunities and potential for automobile technology.
* Analyst Mark Lipacis of Jefferies still sees NVDA as a "top play on secular themes" like AI, gaming, and self-driving vehicles.
* The author notes that analysts are competing with each other to appear to be the "most right," which could propel NVDA stock to its target price.

Target price:

* Jefferies: $227
* UBS: $210
* Consensus target: $187

The article concludes that while it's unlikely NVDA stock will reach its current consensus target, a combination of growth and analyst chatter could push the stock above it. The author notes that the game is not about actually meeting a consensus target, but rather extending the target and leading a trend.
