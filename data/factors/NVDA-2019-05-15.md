The article discusses the recent tariffs imposed by President Trump on Chinese goods, which has negatively impacted NVIDIA's stock price. The author argues that the trade war is unnecessary and will have a negative impact on economies, but advises investors to wait out the storm.

Key points:

* The company's designs are led by Taiwanese expertise, which cannot be replicated by Chinese manufacturers due to intellectual property theft

* The author believes that trade wars are unhealthy for economies and other living things
* Investors should focus on long-term growth and wait for a more stable market.
