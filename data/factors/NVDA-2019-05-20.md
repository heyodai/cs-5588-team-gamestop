The article discusses why Nvidia stock is likely to retreat despite a recent surge in Bitcoin prices. Here are the main points:

1. **Bitcoin dominance**: The author notes that Bitcoin's share of the overall crypto market has surged from 33% in January 2018 to nearly double that recently, while other alternatives like Ethereum have become less popular.
2. **Nvidia's role in mining**: Nvidia cards are used by miners to mine alternative coins, but if these coins aren't surging in price, demand for Nvidia's cards will remain in check.
3. **Weaker-than-expected earnings call**: NVDA noted that its outlook was weaker than expected on its Q1 earnings conference call, and the author suggests that this is due to the escalating trade war with China.
4. **Macro factors outweighing crypto prices**: The author believes that a potential short-lived recovery in Bitcoin prices won't offset bigger macro factors affecting Nvidia stock, including weakness in data center sales and revenue declines.
5. **Nvidia still has to adjust to life without crypto revenue**: NVDA is trying to adjust to the loss of its significant stream of crypto revenue, which fell by over 30% compared to the same quarter last year.

Overall, the article suggests that Nvidia stock will continue to trend lower due to macroeconomic factors and the company's inability to adapt to the loss of crypto revenue.
