Based on the news articles provided, here are the top 5 factors that may affect the stock price of NVDA:

1. **China Trade Dispute**: The ongoing trade dispute between the US and China is affecting Nvidia's prospects in China, which could lead to a decline in its stock price.

2. **Valuation**: The PE ratio of Nvidia stock, like other semiconductor stocks, fluctuates greatly based on changes in investors' sentiment. If the multiple of NVDA stock falls below 20, it may become attractive for short-term and long-term investors.

3. **Competition from Intel and AMD**: Competition from Intel and AMD makes the outlook of NVDA stock more uncertain. While Nvidia leads the way overall, its competitors are gaining ground in certain sectors.

4. **Trade War Resolution**: An event or a meaningful drop in its price-earnings multiples could prompt investors to buy NVDA stock. If the trade war ends, Nvidia's stock price may rise for multiple days, taking the multiple closer to the 55 level seen before the selloff in late 2018.

5. **Valuation Multiples**: The PE ratio of Nvidia stock often fluctuates between 20-55 levels. If traders can buy NVDA at a discount or if market conditions begin to justify a higher PE ratio, it may become attractive for short-term and long-term investors.
