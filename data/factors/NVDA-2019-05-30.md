The article discusses Intel's three-year roadmap, which includes winning on the server front, capturing cloud, data center, and mobile-minded revenue, and responding to an AMD that is creeping into the server and data-center market. The article also touches on Intel's acquisition of Mobileye and its potential impact on autonomous vehicles.

Intel's server business accounts for roughly half of its revenue, making it a significant growth opportunity. However, the company faces challenges in executing on its plan, with analysts projecting low single-digit revenue growth and declining profit margins.

Despite these challenges, some experts believe that Intel's stock could be a good buy due to its undervaluation. The article mentions that Intel's stock is priced at 10 times its trailing earnings and less than 10 times its projected income, making it an attractive option for investors looking for value. Additionally, the article notes that Intel has a number of advantages, including its dominance in the server market and its leadership in the autonomous vehicle space through its acquisition of Mobileye.

The article concludes by stating that while Intel's next three years will be tough, management is committed to executing on its plan, and investors may be wise to take advantage of the stock's undervaluation.
