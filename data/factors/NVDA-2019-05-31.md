The article discusses the current state of NVIDIA's (NVDA) stock and the challenges it faces. The author argues that despite a pullback in the stock price, there are still several concerns that need to be addressed:

1. **Overvaluation**: NVDA stock is trading at nearly 20x fiscal 2019 earnings, which is not particularly cheap for a semiconductor firm.
2. **Competition from AMD**: Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) is becoming a competitor to NVIDIA in the high-end GPU market, potentially eroding NVIDIA's dominance.
3. **Long-term expectations**: The data-center demand and automotive revenue may be lower than expected, and the GPU glut driven by the crypto bubble could stick around for years.

The author suggests that investors who were optimistic about a recovery in Q1 are now facing disappointment, and it will take more than just optimism for NVDA to rally again. Instead, it's likely that better results, such as stronger-than-expected earnings or revenue growth, will be needed to drive the stock price higher.

However, the article also mentions that NVIDIA has other business segments that could help mitigate the challenges faced by the GPU segment. These include:

1. **Professional Visualization**: This segment provides graphics technology for industries such as architecture, engineering, and manufacturing.
2. **Autonomous Vehicles**: NVIDIA is working with companies like Waymo and Tesla to develop autonomous driving technology.

The author notes that these segments could provide a boost to NVDA's revenue and earnings, even if the GPU segment faces challenges.

Overall, the article concludes that while NVDA has some challenges ahead of it, the company still has opportunities for growth in other areas.
