The article discusses the current state of NVIDIA's (NVDA) gaming segment, which has been experiencing a decline in revenue. The company's graphics card specialist business is under threat due to several factors, including:

1. Competition: The rise of cloud gaming and console manufacturers' in-house graphics processing units (GPUs) are challenging NVIDIA's dominance.
2. High prices: Graphics cards have become increasingly expensive, making them less accessible to gamers.
3. Shortage of components: The shortage of certain components, such as memory and silicon, is affecting production and pricing.

Despite this, analysts have maintained a positive outlook on the company, with some even upgrading their price targets. However, investors seem more bearish, driving down the stock price.

The article suggests that investors may be overreacting to the challenges facing NVIDIA's gaming segment, as the company has a strong foundation in other areas, such as:

1. Data centers: NVIDIA is well-positioned to benefit from the growth of cloud computing and artificial intelligence.
2. Artificial intelligence (AI): The company's AI capabilities are expanding into new areas, such as autonomous vehicles and robotics.
