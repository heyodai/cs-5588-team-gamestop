Based on the provided news articles, here are the top 5 factors that may affect the stock price of NVDA (NVIDIA):

1. **Analyst warnings**: Oppenheimer analyst has cautioned on NVIDIA's valuation and growth prospects, suggesting that AMD is a better investment opportunity. This could lead to a decline in NVDA's stock price.

2. **Trade war with China**: The ongoing trade war between the US and China may have a negative impact on NVIDIA's business, particularly if it affects the company's access to Chinese markets or suppliers.

3. **Global economic uncertainty**: The current economic environment, including concerns about global growth and recession, may lead to market volatility and affect the stock price of NVDA.

4. **Short interest**: With extremely low short interest (<1%), investors who seek to profit from falling equity prices are not currently targeting NVIDIA. However, this could change if more investors become bearish on the stock.

5. **ETF activity**: While ETF activity is neutral, a $4.37 billion inflow of funds into ETFs that hold NVDA suggests that some investors may still be bullish on the stock. This influx of capital could lead to increased demand and a subsequent increase in the stock price.

Note: These factors are not exhaustive and other market and economic conditions may also impact the stock price of NVDA.
