Based on the provided news articles, here are the top 5 factors that may affect the stock price of NVDA (NVIDIA):

1. **Slowing demand due to tech ban resulting from U.S.-China trade tensions**: Broadcom's warning about a slowdown in demand has sparked concern among investors, which may also impact NVDA, a company closely tied to the semiconductor industry.
2. **Competition from AMD on upcoming gaming console refreshes**: The loss of GPU sales to AMD on upcoming gaming console refreshes from Sony and Microsoft may negatively impact NVDA's stock price, as it faces increased competition in the gaming sector.
3. **Bitcoin bubble popping**: The recent popping of the bitcoin bubble has led to a decline in demand for GPUs, which could further pressure NVDA's stock price.
4. **Global economic data becoming increasingly disappointing**: The slowdown in industrial output growth in China and the attack on two energy tankers in the Persian Gulf have raised concerns about global economic trends, which may impact investor sentiment and lead to a decline in NVDA's stock price.
5. **Federal Reserve's policy announcement on June 19**: The possibility of interest rate cuts later this year has led to hopes that the Federal Reserve will heed the message of the futures market and prepare for easier credit conditions. However, history reminds us that prior Fed interest rate cuts often came during a recession, which may intensify selling pressure if NVDA's stock price is already under pressure due to the other factors mentioned above.

These factors are interconnected and may have a compounding effect on NVDA's stock price, making it essential for investors to monitor market developments closely.
