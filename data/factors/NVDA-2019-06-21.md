The article discusses the current state of Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) stock and how it has reached its peak. Despite the impressive turnaround led by CEO Lisa Su since 2016, analysts are now hesitant to raise their price targets beyond $30.18. The consensus target has been stable for several weeks, with buy/sell ratings holding steady at "Hold" and the market seeming to agree that the current price is reasonable.

The article notes that this is not the first time AMD's stock has reached a peak, as it happened in 2020 as well. However, this time around, the analyst community is being more cautious, citing that the turnaround story is nearing its end and that investors are now looking for results rather than potential.

The article concludes by stating that while there is always a possibility of further growth, analysts think that the euphoria stage of the turnaround has run its course. The looming "show me" phase is a much tougher one, where AMD will be judged on its results rather than its potential or trajectory.

Key points to consider:

* AMD stock has reached its peak and may not move higher again.
* Analysts are hesitant to raise their price targets beyond $30.18.
* The consensus target has been stable for several weeks.
* Buy/sell ratings are holding steady at "Hold".
* Investors are now looking for results rather than potential.
* The turnaround story is nearing its end.

Investors should consider the following:

* AMD's stock may be due for a correction, but it's hard to predict when or if it will happen.
* Analysts' caution and hesitation to raise price targets could lead to a pullback in the stock.
* Investors should focus on results rather than potential when evaluating AMD's stock performance.

It's essential to do your own research and consider multiple perspectives before making any investment decisions.
