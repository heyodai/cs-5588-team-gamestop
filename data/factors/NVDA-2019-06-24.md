Based on the news articles provided, here are the top 5 factors that may affect the stock price of NVDA (Nvidia):

1. **Rival AMD's New Chip**: The recent release of Advanced Micro Devices' new chip technology has given Nvidia a run for its money, leading to increased competition and potentially lower demand for Nvidia's products.

2. **US Ban on Chinese Supercomputing Firms**: The US ban on certain Chinese supercomputing firms may have implications for the tech industry, particularly companies that rely on international trade and partnerships.

3. **Steel Tariffs**: The recent rejection of a challenge to Trump's steel tariffs by the Supreme Court may lead to increased tensions between the US and other countries, potentially affecting global trade and market sentiment.

4. **Intel's Price Cuts**: Intel's decision to cut prices on its CPUs has given it some breathing room in the market, but it's unclear how long this will last as AMD continues to gain ground with its new chip technology.

5. **Economic Trends**: The overall health of the US economy and the stock market is a key driver of tech stocks like NVDA. A shift away from "Fed Mania" and towards a more sustainable economic growth trajectory could have a positive impact on Nvidia's stock price.

Note that these factors are not necessarily specific to NVDA, but rather broader market trends and events that may impact the tech industry as a whole.
