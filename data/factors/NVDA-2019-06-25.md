Unfortunately, there is no direct mention of NVDA (NVIDIA) stock price or its factors affecting it in the provided news articles. However, based on the content related to NVIDIA and its competitor AMD, I can extract some potential factors that may affect their stock prices:

Top 5 Factors that May Affect NVIDIA Stock Price:

1. **Artificial Intelligence (AI) adoption**: The increasing use of AI is expected to drive demand for advanced computing technologies, potentially benefiting companies like NVIDIA.
2. **Semiconductor industry trends**: The ongoing challenges in the semiconductor industry, such as supply chain constraints and competition from AMD, may impact NVIDIA's stock price.
3. **Capital spending by Intel**: If Wall Street analysts are correct that Intel will boost its capital spending on equipment, it could lead to increased demand for semiconductors and potentially benefit NVIDIA and AMD.
4. **Momentum ETF performance**: The growth of momentum-based investment strategies, as reflected in the iShares Edge MSCI USA Momentum Factor ETF (MTUM), may impact NVIDIA's stock price if investors become increasingly interested in technology stocks with high momentum.
5. **Global economic trends**: The ongoing global economic uncertainty and trade tensions, particularly between the US and China, may continue to affect the semiconductor industry and NVIDIA's stock price.

Please note that these factors are not directly mentioned in the provided news articles but can be inferred based on the content related to AMD and NVIDIA.
