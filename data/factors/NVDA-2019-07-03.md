Based on the news articles, here are the top 5 factors that may affect the stock price of NVDA:

1. **Launch of new GPUs with improved performance**: The recent launch of Turing-based gaming cards GeForce RTX 2060 SUPER, GeForce RTX 2070 SUPER, and GeForce RTX 2080 SUPER, which offer up to 25% faster performance than current versions, may lead to an increase in demand for NVDA's products.
2. **Price cuts and value proposition**: The company's recent price cut strategy may make its products more attractive to gamers, potentially leading to increased sales and revenue growth, which could positively impact the stock price.
3. **ETF inflows**: The significant influx of units into ETFs such as IAU (iShares Gold Trust) and SPHB (SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust) may indicate a growing interest in gold and tech stocks, potentially benefiting NVDA's performance.
4. **Battle with AMD**: NVIDIA's de facto price cut strategy sets up a battle with AMD, which could lead to increased competition and potentially harm NVDA's market share if the price cuts are not enough to offset the competition.
5. **Nasdaq's overall trend**: The Nasdaq's recent weak performance and the overall trading session may indicate caution among investors, potentially leading to a pullback in NVDA's stock price as investors reassess their expectations for the company.
