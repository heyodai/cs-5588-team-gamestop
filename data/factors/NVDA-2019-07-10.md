The article discusses the recent success of AMD stock, but notes that while it's gaining momentum, it also comes with some potential drawbacks. The author suggests that AMD's disruption of the market may come at a cost, and that the company may be overextending itself financially.

Some key points to consider about AMD stock include:

* AMD has been able to disrupt the market with its products, which have rivaled those of Intel and Nvidia in terms of quality.
* However, this disruption comes at a cost, as AMD has struggled with negative free cash flow.
* The author notes that Sony, which disrupted several markets before securing its dominant market share, was also able to raise prices once it had gained traction.
* In contrast, AMD may not have the financial strength to withstand potential storms in the market.

The article also mentions the recent agreement between the US and China to hold off further tariffs, but notes that this peace is tenuous at best. Additionally, the author suggests that semiconductor firms were worried about the trade war prior to the temporary truce, and it's unclear why they're not now.

Overall, the author is cautious about investing in AMD stock, citing the potential risks and uncertainties associated with the company's financial situation and market conditions.
