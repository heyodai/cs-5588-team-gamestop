The article discusses Intel's (INTC) current situation and potential catalysts for a comeback. The author notes that Intel's price-to-earnings (PE) ratio has fallen to around 10.8, which is lower than its peers AMD (AMD) and Nvidia (NVDA). However, the author believes that Intel still needs a significant catalyst to drive buying interest.

The article highlights two potential catalysts for Intel's comeback: the adoption of 5G technology and self-driving cars. Intel has developed products for both technologies, but so have its competitors. The author notes that similar situations in the past, such as AMD's recovery in 2017, suggest that Intel may eventually see a resurgence.

The article also mentions that if Intel were to reach a PE ratio comparable to NVDA's current level of around 30, it would roughly triple the value of INTC stock. This is seen as a potential target for Intel's market cap, which is currently around $211 billion.

Overall, the author suggests that investors should be patient and wait for widespread adoption of these technologies before buying into Intel stock. However, if Intel can regain its technical lead and drive growth in these areas, it has the potential to unlock tremendous value for shareholders.
