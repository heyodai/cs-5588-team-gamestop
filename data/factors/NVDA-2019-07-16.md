Based on the news articles, here are the top 5 factors that may affect the stock price of NVDA (NVIDIA):

1. **Trade War Truce**: The current trade talks between the US and China could impact NVIDIA's stock price, as the company relies heavily on Chinese sales for its graphics processing units (GPUs).
2. **Slowdown in GPU Business**: NVIDIA's GPU business has been a key driver of growth for the company. A slowdown in this segment could negatively impact NVDA's stock price.
3. **Cloud Gaming Platform Competition**: NVIDIA is investing heavily in cloud gaming platforms, which could provide new revenue streams and growth opportunities for the company. However, increased competition from other players like Sony (PS Now) could also impact NVDA's stock price.
4. **Market Volatility**: The overall market trend can impact individual stocks like NVDA. A decline in the S&P 500 or Dow Jones Industrial Average could lead to a decrease in NVIDIA's stock price, while a gain could boost it.
5. **Q2 Earnings Report**: NVIDIA's Q2 earnings report is expected to be crucial in determining the company's stock price. Strong results could lead to analyst upgrades and higher stock prices, while disappointing results could result in a decline.

These factors are interconnected and can impact each other. For example, a slowdown in the GPU business could also affect NVIDIA's stock price due to reduced sales and revenue.
