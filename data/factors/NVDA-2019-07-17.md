Unfortunately, this text does not provide any information about the stock price of NVDA (NVIDIA) or any specific factors that may affect it. The text only discusses the general trend of semiconductors and mentions three semiconductor stocks that are likely to beat earnings expectations.

However, based on NVIDIA's role in the field of semiconductors and its involvement in emerging technologies like AI and IoT, we can make some educated guesses about potential factors that may affect its stock price. Here are five possible factors:

1. **Memory prices**: As mentioned earlier, declining memory prices (DRAM and NAND) have been affecting the semiconductor industry as a whole.
2. **Demand from smartphone OEMs**: Lower demand from smartphone OEMs has also impacted the semiconductor industry.
3. **Artificial intelligence (AI) adoption**: NVIDIA's expertise in AI is likely to be a major factor in its stock price, as the company benefits from increased adoption of AI technologies.
4. **Cloud computing growth**: As more companies move their operations to the cloud, NVIDIA's graphics processing units (GPUs) are being used in cloud infrastructure, which could drive demand for its products and impact its stock price.
5. **Competition from AMD**: As a major competitor to NVIDIA in the semiconductor industry, Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) is likely to be a factor in NVIDIA's stock price, particularly if AMD's products gain significant market share.

Please note that these are just educated guesses based on general trends and may not be specific to NVIDIA's stock price.
