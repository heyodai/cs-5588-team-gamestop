Based on the text, it appears that the author is recommending selling Netflix stock (NFLX) due to weaker-than-expected guidance and a decline in earnings per share estimates. The author suggests that this is a clear sign to move on from the stock and focus on stocks with superior ratings.

The author also mentions their growth investor service, which recommends investing in companies that are well-positioned to benefit from the 5G revolution. However, it's unclear if Netflix is one of these companies or not.

Some possible takeaways from this text include:

* Be cautious of stocks with declining earnings per share estimates and weaker-than-expected guidance.
* Focus on stocks with superior ratings in your portfolio.
* Consider investing in companies that are well-positioned to benefit from emerging technologies like 5G.

It's also worth noting that the author seems to be recommending a conservative approach to investing, prioritizing caution over potential gains. This may not be suitable for all investors, and it's always important to do your own research and consider your individual financial goals and risk tolerance before making investment decisions.
