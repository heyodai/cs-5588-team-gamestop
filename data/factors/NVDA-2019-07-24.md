The article discusses Nvidia's (NVDA) second-half recovery forecast, citing a "crypto hangover" that affected demand for its products in Q3 and Q4 of last year. Despite this, Nvidia expects a rebound in data-center demand, which is driving its growth prospects.

Key points to consider:

1. **Nvidia's guidance**: The company has reiterated its call for a recovery in data-center demand, with CFO Colette Kress stating that Q2 is "still a little cloudy," but the outlook remains broad.
2. **Credibility**: Nvidia management knows its credibility is on the line, and if they were uncertain about their outlook, they would signal it ahead of next month's earnings release.
3. **Analyst sentiment**: Wall Street has become more upbeat on Nvidia stock, with Wedbush initiating a "buy" rating and Piper Jaffray highlighting strong gaming demand ahead.
4. **Valuation**: Nvidia's stock price has rallied sharply in the past seven weeks, trading at 24 times next year's average EPS estimates.

The article concludes that:
