1. **Gaming sales continue to drive revenue**: Despite a drop in gaming sales over the past year, the demand for gaming products is still strong, with gaming laptops becoming a growing trend. Nvidia's Max-Q gaming laptops have seen increased sales.
2. **Nvidia expands into autonomous vehicles**: Nvidia offers a chip called Tegra that combines GPUs and CPUs, which is used in Tesla's vehicles. The company has also partnered with Uber (NASDAQ:UBER) to launch pilot programs for self-driving cars.
3. **Machine learning business shows promise**: Nvidia's technology allows networks to process data up to 20 times faster than competitors, making it a preferred choice for companies like Facebook (NASDAQ:FB).
