This article is presenting a bullish outlook on Nvidia (NVDA) stock, citing improving global semiconductor market fundamentals as the reason for this optimism. The author points out that the company's core fundamentals are finally starting to improve after a multi-quarter stretch of temporary but ugly turbulence.

Here are some key points from the article:

*   Global semiconductor sales are showing early signs of bottoming out and turning around, with a month-over-month gain in May.
*   The forecast calls for a 2019 year-over-year sales decline of 12%, and a 2020 year-over-year sales gain of over 5%.
*   Microdata confirms this macro outlook, with Texas Instruments (TXN), Teradyne (TER), Mellanox (MLNX), and Intel (INTC) all reporting strong Q2 numbers.
*   Nvidia has broad exposure to all of tomorrow's most important markets, including hyperscale data-center space and AI verticals.
*   The company has very little price competition in these markets, implying that margins have room to move higher in the long haul.
*   Nvidia stock trades at 32-times forward earnings, which is a big multiple for a semiconductor stock. However, the average long-term projected earnings growth rate across the semiconductor space is 11%, and for Nvidia, it's 15%.
*   The author models suggest that $13 in EPS is achievable for Nvidia by 2025, assuming double-digit revenue growth and steady margin expansion.
*   Based on a growth-average 20 forward multiple, that yields a long-term price target for NVDA stock of $260.

Overall, the article presents a bullish outlook on Nvidia stock, citing improving global semiconductor market fundamentals as the reason for this optimism.
