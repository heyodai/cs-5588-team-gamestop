The article discusses Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) stock and its potential performance in the upcoming earnings report. The author notes that AMD has outperformed its competitors and has introduced new technologies, such as the 7 nm Zen 2 architecture, which is expected to be released in September. However, the author also mentions that the semiconductor industry is experiencing a chip glut brought about by last year's decline in crypto and the U.S.-China trade war, which may impact AMD's stock price.

The author recommends buying AMD stock before earnings, but with caution, as the $34-per-share price level has become critical for AMD. If the earnings report does not deliver positive guidance, AMD could head down in the near term. The author suggests taking a partial position now and waiting to see how the stock performs after the earnings report.

The article also mentions that AMD is not just competing with Intel, but also with Nvidia, and that the company's 7 nm Zen 2 architecture poses a challenge to Nvidia's graphics chip market share. However, it's worth noting that Nvidia still has a strong presence in the graphics market, and the competition between the two companies may be fierce.

Overall, the author believes that AMD is a good long-term investment opportunity, but recommends exercising caution in the short term due to the uncertainty surrounding the earnings report and the chip glut.
