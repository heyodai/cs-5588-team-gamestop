I couldn't find any information about NVDA (NVIDIA) in the provided news article. However, I can extract some factors that may affect the stock price of a semiconductor company like AMD from the article:

1. Sales performance: The article mentions that AMD's revenue from computing and graphics reached $940 million, which missed estimates of $983 million. This could impact the stock price if investors were expecting higher sales.

2. Competition: The article notes that AMD faces strong competition in the marketplace, particularly from Nvidia (NVDA) in the GPU market. If AMD is unable to gain ground on its competitors, it may negatively impact the stock price.

3. Product development: The article mentions that AMD invests a lot of time and money in developing new and exciting products, which could positively impact the stock price if these products are successful.

4. Guidance: The article notes that AMD lowered its expected sales growth to a single-digit percentage, which may be seen as a negative by investors. However, it's worth noting that the company's guidance was still mostly in line with what analysts were anticipating.

5. Analyst sentiment: The article mentions that 18 analysts raised their price targets after the earnings report, which could positively impact the stock price if more investors follow suit.
