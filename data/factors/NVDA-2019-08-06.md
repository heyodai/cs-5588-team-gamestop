Based on the news articles, here are the top 5 factors that may affect the stock price of NVDA (NVIDIA):

1. **Trade War with China**: The ongoing trade war with China is likely to continue affecting Micron's (MU) sales, and by extension, NVIDIA's revenue, as 57% of Micron's sales come from China.
2. **Oversupply of Chips**: The oversupply of chips in the market, particularly for DRAM and NAND memory chips, is expected to persist until at least 2020, which may lead to lower prices and reduced demand for NVIDIA's products.
3. **Increased Competition from Intel**: Intel's efforts to challenge NVIDIA and AMD's dominance in the gaming GPU market may pose a threat to NVIDIA's share of the market, particularly if Intel can improve its integrated GPU technology.
4. **Memory Chip Price Decline**: The decline in memory chip prices, including DRAM and NAND, is likely to continue affecting NVIDIA's revenue and profitability, as the company relies heavily on these chips for its products.
5. **Trade War Concerns and Chinese Company Investment**: The escalating trade war with China and the increased investment by Chinese companies in domestic chip production may lead to concerns about the long-term impact on NVIDIA's business, particularly if China's dependence on American chipmakers is reduced.

Note that these factors are not unique to NVDA and may also affect other stocks in the technology sector.
