The article discusses the recent partnership between Nvidia, VMware, and Amazon's AWS on an artificial intelligence initiative. While this deal is expected to help Nvidia, it may not necessarily boost the stock price due to current economic and trade concerns.

**Key Points:**

*   The partnership will provide an accelerated GPU technology for VMware Cloud on Amazon Web Services.
*   This technology will support large businesses using AWS and facilitate VMware's vSphere-based applications move to the cloud.
*   It will also give customers access to features such as data analytics, video processing, and machine learning.

**Market Impact:**

*   The deal is expected to enhance Nvidia's strategy to explore new markets and partner with large enterprises on AI.
*   However, Nvidia faces competition from Advanced Micro Devices (AMD), which recently announced the development of a Nervana AI chip for deep learning and deep learning inference.
*   Chinese tech giant Huawei will soon launch a competing AI chip, which may pose a threat to Nvidia's market share.

**Economic Outlook:**

*   The global chip market is expected to experience a slowdown due to a glut in supply.
*   This has led to reduced profits across the industry, including Nvidia.
*   However, Wall Street predicts average annual growth of 12.5% for Nvidia over the next five years.

**Trading Strategies:**

*   Some investors recommend buying Nvidia stock when President Donald Trump tweets negative things about China and selling when he speaks nicely of the country.
*   Others suggest a long-term approach, focusing on the company's potential to define the cutting edge of technology in various sectors.

**Conclusion:**

The partnership between Nvidia, VMware, and AWS is expected to enhance the graphics chip maker's strategy. However, the current economic outlook and competition from other companies may impact the stock price. Investors should consider a long-term approach and be cautious when making decisions about Nvidia stock.
