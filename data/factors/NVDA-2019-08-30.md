It appears that the article is discussing the stock market and NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA) specifically. The main points are:

* NVIDIA's second-quarter earnings report was successful, with Wall Street impressed by its gaming business.
* The company is gaining financial success in this market, driven by its growth in the graphics card industry.
* AMD (NASDAQ:AMD) also gained ground against NVIDIA in the graphics card market during the second quarter, although it remains a distant second.

The article does not explicitly mention JD.com or its stock price. However, it does make a reference to Dana Blankenhorn's comment about buying Nvidia when Trump tweets negative things about China and selling when his rhetoric turns nice. The author suggests that they could say the same thing about JD.com, implying that investors should wait for a dip in the stock price before buying.

Overall, the article is focused on the tech industry and the performance of NVIDIA and AMD, with some mention of the trade war between the US and China as a potential factor affecting stock prices.
