Based on the provided news articles, here are the top 5 factors that may affect the stock price of NVDA:

1. **Trade War Uncertainty**: The ongoing trade war between the US and China is a significant concern for NVDA, as the company has strong relationships with Chinese companies and relies on exports to China. Any escalation or disruption in trade can impact NVDA's revenue and profits.

2. **Competition in AI and Autonomous Driving**: NVDA faces competition from other chipmakers like AMD and Intel in the rapidly growing field of artificial intelligence (AI) and autonomous driving. While NVDA has a strong presence in these areas, its market share is not yet guaranteed, and competition can impact its stock price.

3. **Comparison to Previous Quarters**: Analysts expect the second half of 2019 to be a strong period for NVDA's revenue growth, as comparisons become easier with previous quarters. However, if the company fails to meet expectations or faces unexpected challenges, it may negatively impact its stock price.

4. **Global Economic Worry**: The global economic environment is still uncertain, and any slowdown or recession could have a negative impact on demand for NVDA's products. While JPMorgan has taken a bullish view of semiconductor demand in the second half, there are still concerns about the overall economy.

5. **Pricing Multiple**: NVDA's stock price is currently trading at 31 times its forecasted earnings, which some analysts consider too expensive for the risk involved. If investors become concerned about the company's valuation or growth prospects, it could impact the stock price negatively.
