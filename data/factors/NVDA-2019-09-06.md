The article provides three stock charts analysis for Friday:

1. **Starbucks (SBUX)**: The stock stumbled but was largely recovered by the closing bell, thanks to support from the 50-day moving average line. The weekly chart shows that SBUX is overbought and has weak volume behind its recent gains.
2. **AT&T (T)**: AT&T shares have been on fire recently, pushing T stock to a multi-month high yesterday. However, the stock is bumping back into technical resistance and may not sustain its momentum. The weekly chart shows that T stock is testing its key highs since February.
3. **Church & Dwight (CHD)**: CHD shares have been strong performers this year but stumbled on Thursday, potentially due to an accusation from a short-seller. The weekly chart shows that the selloff may be a clue that the rally effort is cracking. A possible landing point for any pullback could be near $66.40.

The article concludes by noting that investors should consider these charts and potential trades:

* BAC (Bank of America)
* TWTR (Twitter)
* NVDA (NVIDIA)
* BB (BB&T)
* MDB (Meritor)

However, the article does not provide specific trade recommendations or guidance for each stock.
