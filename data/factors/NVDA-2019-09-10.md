Here's a summary of the article and some key points about AMD stock:

**Summary:** Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) has made a significant turnaround under the leadership of CEO Lisa Su, led by her technical and engineering expertise. The company's stock price has risen 1500% since 2016, but its growth is now slowing down, and investors are uncertain about what to expect in the future.

**Key Points:**

1. **Turnaround complete**: The turnaround effort has largely been completed, and the company is now reflecting its maximum plausible value.
2. **Bullish case fading**: The majority of traders have already signaled their uncertainty, and the bears have a slight edge, as AMD stock has fallen under the rising support line.
3. **Bearish undertow**: Until AMD stock breaks back under the 100-day moving average line at $30.19, none of the bearish undertow matters.
4. **200-day moving average line**: If the floor snaps, the next best target becomes the 200-day moving average line at $26.33.
5. **Market uncertainty**: AMD stock is increasingly tied to the broad market's tide and may move with it rather than defy its undertow.
