The article discusses the current state of Nvidia's stock and whether it's a good idea to buy or hold onto it. Here are the main points:

1. **Nvidia's recent price increase**: The stock has gained 12% since September 3, up 38% so far in 2019.
2. **Analyst sentiment**: Most analysts have Nvidia rated as a Buy, but their average 12-month price target is $189.27, which implies only 3% upside from current levels.
3. **Gaming console cycle**: Nvidia is missing out on the next-generation game console cycle, which will benefit Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) instead.
4. **Cloud gaming initiative**: Google's Stadia cloud game streaming service will use custom AMD GPUs, reducing demand for graphics cards and potentially hurting Nvidia's sales.
5. **Investment in AI and autonomous driving**: While this area has long-term potential, it's not expected to drive significant growth in the next year.
6. **Buying decision**: If you already own Nvidia stock, holding onto it with a long-term perspective is a good idea, as its investment in AI and autonomous driving technology will likely pay off in the future.

Overall, the article suggests that Nvidia's stock has reached a ceiling, and buying now may not yield significant gains over the next year. However, if you're willing to hold onto it for the long term, it may still be a good investment.
