The article discusses three stocks that are showing promising signs: Micron Technology (MU), Johnson Controls (JCI), and Wells Fargo (WFC). Here's a summary of the key points:

**Micron Technology (MU)**

* MU stock found support at the 100-day moving average line, which is a critical level.
* The stock has been showing strength despite last week's stumble.
* A rising support line from 2016 and a yellow dashed line connecting highs since April suggest that the trend is still bullish.

**Johnson Controls (JCI)**

* JCI's turnaround rally has slowed down this year, but the recent plunge between Tuesday and Thursday was abrupt.
* The stock broke below the rising support line and the purple 50-day moving average line, which were previously supporting it.
* However, the stock only needed to touch the gray 100-day moving average line to start a rebound effort.

**Wells Fargo (WFC)**

* WFC's head and shoulders pattern formed in late April, but shares didn't recover until last month.
* The stock has been forming a rebound effort since then, with Thursday's bar sealing the deal.
* A golden cross is expected when the 50-day moving average line crosses above the 200-day moving average line.

Overall, these stocks are showing signs of potential recovery, but it's essential to keep in mind that past performance is not indicative of future results.
