It's difficult to say whether it's time to invest in NVDA stock given the current market conditions and factors that could affect its growth. While there are reasons to be optimistic about Nvidia's prospects, including its pending purchase of Mellanox Technologies and strong revenue growth from its automotive division, there are also potential risks such as a lingering "crypto hangover" affecting the gaming business and the ongoing trade war with China.

Analysts have raised their price targets for NVDA stock, citing strong growth prospects in various segments. However, it's essential to consider these factors before making any investment decisions.

Some key points to consider:

1.  **Mellanox Acquisition**: The purchase of Mellanox Technologies is expected to boost Nvidia's data-center business and help the company grow its revenue.
2.  **Gaming Division**: While the gaming division faces competition from rival Advanced Micro Devices (AMD), Nvidia remains a strong player in this market.
3.  **Automotive Division**: The automotive division has seen significant growth, with record revenue reached last quarter.
4.  **China Risks**: As a significant portion of Nvidia's revenue comes from China, the ongoing trade war between the US and China poses a risk to the company's growth.

Ultimately, whether it's time to invest in NVDA stock depends on individual market perspectives and investment goals.
