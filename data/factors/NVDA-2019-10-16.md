Based on the news articles, here are the top 5 factors that may affect the stock price of NVDA (Nvidia):

1. **Earnings and Revenue Growth**: Bank of America raised its 12-month target price for NVDA from $225 to $250 after Nvidia's earnings beat expectations. However, some analysts believe that NVDA's earnings growth has slowed down, which could impact its stock price.
2. **Free Cash Flow Generation**: Intel's free cash flow generation continues to be strong, and this is seen as a better indicator of value for investors than earnings or sales. If NVDA's free cash flow generation does not meet expectations, it could negatively impact its stock price.
3. **Momentum and Sentiment**: The stock market is near highs after rising for a decade, and momentum investors are now buying shares of Apple, Amazon, and Netflix. A similar sentiment towards NVDA's stock could drive up its price if investors become more optimistic about its growth prospects.
4. **Trade Tensions and Earnings Concerns**: Doubts lingered over a partial deal between the US and China, which led to a dip in US futures on Wednesday. If trade tensions continue to affect global markets, it could negatively impact NVDA's stock price, especially if the company's earnings are impacted by the uncertainty.
5. **Valuation and Payout Ratio**: Analysts believe that NVDA's valuation is high compared to its peers, with some arguing that the company's payout ratio of 36% is relatively low for a tech stock. If investors become more concerned about NVDA's valuation, it could lead to a decline in its stock price.

Note: These factors are not exhaustive, and other news articles may mention additional factors that could impact NVDA's stock price.
