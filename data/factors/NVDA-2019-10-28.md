**Growth Prospects:** AMD has strong growth prospects, with estimates calling for a dramatic acceleration in growth for both the top and bottom line. Consensus expectations call for revenue to grow roughly 25% next year to $8.46 billion and profits to jump 68% to $1.06 per share.

**Trading Strategy:**

* If shares maintain above $32, look to see how they handle the $34+ area.
* AMD stock has been susceptible to volatility and large drawdowns, but buyers have stepped up near vital support (around $27.50-$28).
* If AMD fails to hold $32, look to see if it can stay above the 50-day moving average.

**Key Levels:**

* Vital level of support sits down between $27.50 and $28.
* Notable support at around $27.50-$28.
* 61.8% retracement and 200-day moving average at this price range.

Overall, the advice suggests that investors should be looking at AMD's growth prospects and valuation, as well as its trading strategy and key levels of support and resistance.
