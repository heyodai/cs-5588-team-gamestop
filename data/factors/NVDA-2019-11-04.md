Based on the news, here are the top 5 factors that may affect the stock price of NVDA:

1. **Earnings Release**: The upcoming Q3 earnings release by NVIDIA may impact the stock price, as investors will be eager to know how the company's recent turnaround and strong demand for its products will translate into financial performance.

2. **Cryptocurrency Demand**: The loss of cryptocurrency demand last October had a negative impact on NVDA's stock price. If cryptocurrency demand recovers or remains stable, this could positively affect the stock price.

3. **Support at 10-day Moving Average**: NVIDIA's stock has found support at its 10-day moving average, which may indicate a trend reversal or consolidation. This could lead to an uptick in the stock price as investors buy into the rebound.

4. **Health of Balance Sheet**: As a popular metric for assessing the health of a company's balance sheet, the current ratio may impact NVDA's stock price. A strong current ratio indicates that the company has sufficient liquidity to meet its short-term obligations, which could boost investor confidence and drive up the stock price.

5. **Overall Market Sentiment**: The overall sentiment in the market may also affect NVDA's stock price. If investors are optimistic about the broader market or specific sectors (e.g., technology), this could lead to increased buying pressure and a rise in the stock price.
