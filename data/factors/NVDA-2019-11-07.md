Based on the news articles, here are the top 5 factors that may affect the stock price of NVDA:

1. **Datacenter launch timing**: The expected delay in Nvidia's datacenter launch from the current quarter to either the first or second quarter of 2020 could impact investor expectations and potentially lower stock prices.
2. **Earnings expectations**: Analysts estimate a decline in earnings for Nvidia, which may lead to decreased investor confidence and lower stock prices.
3. **Quarter-end deals**: The lack of quarter-end deals from suppliers indicating that sales are running below expectations could be seen as an encouraging sign by investors, potentially supporting the stock price.
4. **Sales performance**: Historically, suppliers have suggested that Nvidia makes quarter-end deals if sales are slow, which could indicate a slowdown in sales and impact investor confidence.
5. **Revenue push late in the quarter**: The absence of a push for revenue late in the quarter may suggest that Nvidia is managing its expectations and avoiding a last-minute sales surge, potentially affecting investor sentiment and stock prices.
