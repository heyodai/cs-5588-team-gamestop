Based on the article, it seems that Nio stock price experienced a 37% gain after announcing a partnership with Mobileye, a company acquired by Intel. However, the author of the article is skeptical about the significance of this gain and does not believe it will have an immediate impact on Nio's vehicle sales or revenue.

The author points out that Nio's sales and earnings have not changed significantly, and its balance sheet has not been meaningfully improved by the deal. Additionally, Tesla's presence in China, where Nio operates, is a concern for Nio, as Tesla has a stronger position in electric vehicles and Autopilot technology.

The author concludes that while the Mobileye announcement is good news for Nio, it does not make Nio stock worth buying at current prices. They suggest that Nio's shares are still too expensive and that there are better stocks to buy than Nio.
