The article discusses the potential for Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) stock to continue its impressive growth in 2020. Here are some key points:

1. **Year-to-date performance**: AMD's stock has increased by over 120% so far this year, outpacing the broader market.
2. **Semi-custom chip segment underperformance**: The firm's semi-custom chip segment has underperformed this year, but management expects it to pick up significantly in 2020 due to new gaming consoles releasing with AMD chips.
3. **New console releases**: Sony and Microsoft are using AMD chips in their latest console models, which should boost sales of semi-custom chips.
4. **Size is not an issue**: Despite being smaller than competitors like Intel (INTC) and NVIDIA (NVDA), AMD has been able to grow its market share in the CPU market for eight consecutive quarters and expand its data center business.
5. **Advantage over Intel**: AMD beat Intel to market with its 7-nanometer chips, giving it an advantage in the tech space where most firms opt for the latest version.
6. **Growth prospects**: The launch of new 7-nm products is expected to drive above-consensus growth, share gains, margin expansion, and AMD share appreciation.
7. **Valuation**: Despite its recent run-up, AMD's stock price is not outrageous, trading at 66 times future earnings, compared to 37x for NVDA and 12x for INTC.

Overall, the article suggests that AMD stock has strong growth prospects in 2020, driven by new console releases, expanding semi-custom chip sales, and an advantage over Intel. However, investors should be cautious of potential turbulence in Q4 due to depressed semi-custom sales and potential negative news on the trade deal with China.
