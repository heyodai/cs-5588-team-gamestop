2. **Rise of Facial Recognition Technology**: The growing adoption of facial recognition technology, particularly in China, may drive up demand for AI-powered solutions like those offered by NVIDIA, potentially boosting its stock price.
3. **Intel's Chip Shortage and Potential Acquisition of Habana Labs**: Intel's struggles with a chip shortage and potential acquisition of Habana Labs could impact NVDA's stock price if it perceived as a threat to its dominant position in the AI market or if it sees NVIDIA as a competitor for AI-related business.
4. **Dell's Shift towards AMD Chips**: Dell's decision to shift towards AMD chips due to Intel's chip shortage may lead to reduced demand for NVIDIA's graphics processing units, negatively impacting its stock price.
5. **General Market Uncertainty and Dow Futures Sinking**: The overall market uncertainty, particularly the sharp decline in US futures on Tuesday after President Trump hinted at delayed trade talks with China, could lead to a broader sell-off in the tech sector, including NVIDIA's stock.
