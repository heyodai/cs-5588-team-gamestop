Unfortunately, none of the news articles provided any information about the stock price of NVIDIA (NVDA). However, I can try to make some educated guesses based on the general market trends and industry developments mentioned in the articles.

Here are five factors that may affect the stock price of NVDA:

1. **Trade deal optimism**: If a phase-one U.S.-China trade deal is successfully negotiated, it could lead to increased demand for NVIDIA's graphics processing units (GPUs) used in gaming, AI, and other applications.
2. **Artificial intelligence (AI) adoption**: As Intel reportedly plans to acquire Habana Labs to enhance its AI chip development capabilities, NVIDIA may benefit from the increasing demand for AI technology, which could drive up NVDA's stock price.
3. **Competition in the mini PC market**: AMD's launch of mini PCs powered by Ryzen Embedded Processors may create competition for NVIDIA's own graphics-based solutions, potentially affecting NVDA's stock price.
4. **Macroeconomic trends**: The articles mention "macroeconomic woes" and a decline across all segments for Marvell (MRVL). While this is not directly related to NVIDIA, macroeconomic trends can impact the overall market sentiment and, by extension, NVDA's stock price.
5. **Supply chain and semiconductor industry developments**: The trade talks and potential acquisitions in the AI chip sector may lead to changes in supply chain dynamics or regulatory environments that could impact NVIDIA's operations, leading to fluctuations in its stock price.

Please note that these are speculative factors and not directly related to any specific information about NVDA's financial performance or business strategy.
