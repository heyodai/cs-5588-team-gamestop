Based on the provided news articles, here are the top 5 factors that may affect the stock price of NVDA (NVIDIA):

1. **Revenue growth**: Analysts at Stifel suggest buying tech stocks because revenue is expected to rise, implying that a strong revenue performance could boost NVDA's stock price.
2. **Competition from new chip makers**: The emergence of aggressive young chip makers with products that can displace NVIDIA's GPUs may pose a threat to the company's market share and stock price.
3. **Huawei subsidy ban**: The FCC's decision to ban carriers from using federal funds to purchase equipment from Huawei could have an indirect impact on NVDA, as some carriers might switch to alternative suppliers or reduce their purchases of NVIDIA-based equipment.
4. **Regulatory challenges**: As a major tech company, NVIDIA may face regulatory challenges in the future, which could affect its stock price if the company is unable to navigate these challenges effectively.
5. **Global economic trends**: Although not explicitly mentioned in the articles, global economic trends and market conditions can also impact NVDA's stock price. A strong global economy with growing demand for AI and GPU-based technologies could support NVIDIA's stock price, while a recession or slowdown in growth could negatively affect it.
