The article discusses the potential for Nvidia Corporation (NVDA) stock to continue its upward trend due to its expertise in artificial intelligence (AI) and its dominance in the market. Here are some key points from the article:

1. **Recent Financial Results**: Nvidia's Q3 earnings were impressive, with EPS of $1.78 and revenue of $3.01 billion, beating analyst expectations.
2. **Q4 Expectations**: Management expects Q4 revenues to be between $2.89 billion and $3.01 billion, which would end the company's consecutive series of quarterly sales declines.
3. **Competitive Risks**: Despite the positive financial results, Nvidia faces competitive risks from companies like Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) and Intel, which are encroaching on the AI training space.
4. **Overhang of US-China Trade War**: The ongoing trade war between the US and China is a concern for Nvidia, as Chinese authorities may block its pending acquisition of Mellanox Technologies.
5. **Granularity of AI**: AI can be divided into two categories: training and inference. Nvidia's expertise in chipset technologies positions it well to dominate the latter category, which involves computers applying pre-trained models to variable conditions and stimuli.
6. **Long-term Upside Potential**: The AI market offers significant growth opportunities for Nvidia, with McKinsey & Company predicting that it will be a major beneficiary of the industry's growth over the next decade.

Overall, while Nvidia faces competitive risks, its expertise in AI and dominance in the market position it well for long-term success. However, investors should be cautious of the potential overhang from the US-China trade war and continue to monitor the company's progress in this space.
