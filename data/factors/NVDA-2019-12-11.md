Based on the news articles provided, here are the top 5 factors that may affect the stock price of NVDA (Nvidia):

1. **Semiconductor industry growth and prospects**: The semiconductor industry is expected to experience a comeback in 2020, which could positively impact companies like Nvidia. This growth could lead to increased demand for Nvidia's GPUs and other semiconductor products.
