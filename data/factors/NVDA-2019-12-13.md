Based on the news article, here are the top 5 factors that may affect the stock price of NVDA (NVIDIA Corporation):

1. **U.S.-China trade relations**: The uncertainty surrounding a trade agreement between the US and China is a significant risk factor for NVIDIA's stock price, as the company has a significant presence in China.

2. **Trade deal cut in principle**: If the Trump administration delays new tariffs on Chinese imports or halves existing tariffs, sector ETFs may soar, potentially benefiting NVIDIA's stock price.

3. **China business challenges**: As mentioned earlier, AMD (Advanced Micro Devices) is heavily dependent on China for revenue, and any significant decline in Chinese revenue could impact NVIDIA's stock price as well.

4. **Global economic growth**: The global economy is starting to show signs of a potential turnaround, which could have a positive impact on NVIDIA's stock price if the company can benefit from increased demand for its graphics processing units (GPUs).

5. **Trade tensions and tariffs**: The ongoing trade tensions between the US and China, including the imposition of new tariffs, could lead to a decline in NVIDIA's stock price as the company may be negatively impacted by higher costs or reduced demand.

These factors highlight the potential risks and opportunities facing NVIDIA's stock price, particularly in relation to its business in China.
