Based on the provided text, it appears that Nvidia's stock is currently overvalued, but investor sentiment is still in its favor, making it a good time to consider going long. The company's growth premium compared to dinosaur Intel (a reference to Intel's outdated technology) justifies a higher valuation multiple.

However, there are some concerns about the current valuation being "frothy," and it's unclear when or if investor sentiment will turn bearish in 2020. Nevertheless, analyst Ruben Roy from Benchmark has recently raised his price target for Nvidia (NVDA) to $275, citing expectations of strong revenue and earnings growth in fiscal 2021.

Some key points to consider:

* Nvidia's stock has been on a tear lately, with a 74% year-to-date gain.
* The company is expected to benefit from an acceleration of data center spending and improving demand for GPUs in gaming end markets.
* Benchmark analyst Ruben Roy has raised his price target for NVDA to $275, citing strong revenue and earnings growth expectations for fiscal 2021.
* The stock has a large weight in the ARK Autonomous Technology & Robotics ETF (ARKQ), which suggests that investors are bullish on autonomous technology and robotics trends.

Ultimately, whether or not to invest in Nvidia's stock depends on individual market analysis and risk tolerance. It may be worth considering the following:

* Keep an eye on investor sentiment and market trends.
* Consider the company's growth potential and competitive advantage.
* Weigh the pros and cons of going long vs. short on NVDA.
* Monitor the analyst ratings and price targets to gauge market expectations.
