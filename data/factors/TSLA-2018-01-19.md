Based on the news articles provided, here are the top 5 factors that may affect the stock price of TSLA (Tesla):

1. **Production bottlenecks and quality control issues**: Tesla's focus on solving production bottlenecks and improving the quality of its vehicles could impact its stock price. According to Cowen & Co.'s Jeffrey Osborne, consumers buying lower-priced Model 3 vehicles may be less forgiving than wealthier buyers of the Model X if there are issues with these cars.
2. **Growing competition in electric and autonomous cars**: The increasing presence of competitors like BMW and Ford in the electric and autonomous car market could put pressure on Tesla's stock price. If Tesla fails to innovate or improve its offerings, it may struggle to maintain its market share.
3. **Delays in production or expansion plans**: According to Osborne, if delays continue, Tesla may need to issue bonds or dilute shareholder equity, which could negatively impact its stock price.
4. **Tax windfall and valuation implications for Apple Inc (AAPL)**: While not directly related to TSLA, the news about Apple's potential trillion-dollar valuation could have a ripple effect on the tech industry as a whole. If investors begin to shift their focus to other companies that may benefit from similar growth opportunities, it could impact TSLA's stock price.
5. **Shift in consumer preferences towards autonomous driving and vehicle ownership**: The article highlighting Ford's decision to allow owners to drive themselves in a Lamborghini Aventador suggests that there may be a shift in consumer preferences towards autonomy over autonomous vehicles. If this trend continues, it could impact demand for Tesla's vehicles and, subsequently, its stock price.

Note that these factors are not exhaustive, and the overall health of the stock market and the tech industry will continue to play a significant role in determining TSLA's stock price.
