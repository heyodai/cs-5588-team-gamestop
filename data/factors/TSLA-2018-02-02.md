Based on the text, here are some key points about Tesla's electric truck charging stations:

1. **Partnerships**: Tesla is partnering with Anheuser-Busch, PepsiCo, and UPS to build charging stations for its electric Semi trucks.
2. **On-site charging**: The companies will work together to install charging stations at the customers' shipping facilities, which will enable the trucks to charge while they are being serviced.
3. **Initial routes**: The initial routes for the Semis will be short enough that the trucks can go out and back again on a single charge, making the need for frequent recharging unnecessary.
4. **Combined charging facilities**: Pepsi has expressed interest in potentially partnering with other companies using Tesla trucks to create combined charging facilities.
5. **Tariffs**: The 30% tariff on solar panels coming into the US starting next month will not impact every end market equally, particularly rooftop solar systems which are inherently more expensive.
6. **Flamethrower sales**: Elon Musk's $500 flamethrower sold for $10 million worth in four days to promote his latest Los Angeles car tunnel venture, The Boring Co.
