Based on the provided news articles, here are the top 5 factors that may affect the stock price of TSLA (Tesla):

1. **Production and Supply Chain Issues**: Tesla's struggles to meet its Model 3 production targets have raised concerns about the company's ability to scale up production efficiently. This has led to a decline in the stock price, with some analysts warning that the bottom may not be in yet.

2. **Competition from Jaguar Land Rover and Other EV Makers**: The article mentions that Jaguar Land Rover is gaining traction in the electric vehicle (EV) market, which could pose a threat to Tesla's market share. This competition could lead to a decrease in TSLA's stock price as investors reassess their investment.

3. **Valuation Multiples and Capital Intensiveness**: As mentioned in one of the articles, the automotive industry is capital-intensive, and valuation multiples are commonly used in such sectors.
