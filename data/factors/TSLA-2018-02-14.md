Based on the provided news articles, here are the top 5 factors that may affect the stock price of TSLA (Tesla Inc.):

1. **Battery Bubble**: The growth in battery production could lead to an "enormous" growth in the industry, but investing in companies that produce batteries might not be a winner, according to a prominent hedge fund manager. This could impact Tesla's stock price if investors become wary of the company's dependence on battery production.

2. **China Dream Uncertainty**: The uncertainty surrounding Tesla's China dream, including a standoff over Shanghai factory, could impact the company's sales and revenue growth in the world's largest EV market. A failure to secure a local partner or overcome import tax issues could negatively affect TSLA's stock price.

3. **FCC Approval for SpaceX Broadband**: The proposed approval of Elon Musk's SpaceX application for broadband services using satellites could have a positive impact on Tesla's stock price if the FCC approves it. Satellite internet technology could provide a new revenue stream for SpaceX, and by extension, Tesla.

4. **Overvaluation Concerns**: Some analysts believe that Tesla's stock price has become overvalued, with shares crossing above the average analyst 12-month target price of $320. If investors become concerned about the company's valuation, they may sell their shares, leading to a decline in TSLA's stock price.

5. **Tesla Firing on All Cylinders vs. Battery Bubble**: The article "Tesla Firing On All Cylinders - Victor Dergunov's Idea Of The Month" presents a bullish outlook on Tesla's prospects, suggesting that the company is firing on all cylinders and has a strong growth potential. However, this may be at odds with concerns about the battery bubble, which could impact TSLA's stock price if investors become overly optimistic about the company's prospects.

Note that these factors are not exhaustive, and other news articles may also have an impact on Tesla's stock price.
