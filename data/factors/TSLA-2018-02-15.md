Based on the provided news articles, here are the top 5 factors that may affect the stock price of TSLA (Tesla):

1. **Battery production and grid integration**: The success of Tesla's world's biggest battery in Australia is doing its job too well, which could impact the company's ability to scale up production and meet demand for its energy storage solutions. This could lead to a positive or negative reaction in the stock market depending on how well Tesla can integrate its batteries with the grid.

2. **Model 3 sales and production**: The upcoming launch of the Model 3 in Atlanta, as well as Tesla's plans to expand SUV production by 25% in 2018, could impact the company's revenue and profitability. A successful launch and increased production could lead to a positive stock price reaction, while any issues or delays could negatively impact shares.

3. **Self-driving car technology**: The National Safety Council's preliminary estimates of over 40,000 U.S. motor vehicle deaths in 2017 highlight the need for safe transportation solutions. Tesla's self-driving car technology is seen as a potential solution to this problem, and investors may be monitoring its progress closely. A successful implementation of autonomous driving could lead to increased sales and a positive stock price reaction.

4. **Manufacturing and production capacity**: Tesla's plans to become the world's best manufacturer, with a focus on manufacturing rather than product design, could impact the company's ability to meet demand for its products. If Tesla is able to increase its production capacity and improve its manufacturing efficiency, it could lead to a positive stock price reaction. However, any issues or delays in meeting production targets could negatively impact shares.

5. **Competition from other companies**: The article mentions Cisco Systems' strong earnings report, which could impact the technology sector as a whole. Additionally, the article notes that Ford is revving up SUV production, which could potentially compete with Tesla's electric vehicles for market share. Any negative news about these competitors or changes in the market landscape could negatively impact TSLA shares.
