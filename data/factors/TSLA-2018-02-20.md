Based on the provided news articles, here are the top 5 factors that may affect the stock price of TSLA (Tesla Inc.):

1. **Production delays and Model 3 shortage**: The prolonged wait for an affordable Tesla, particularly for the base Standard model, may continue to impact production and demand, affecting the company's stock price.

2. **Security breach and cryptocurrency mining**: A data breach in which hackers hijacked an Amazon Cloud account to mine cryptocurrency could raise concerns about Tesla's cybersecurity measures and potentially affect investor confidence, leading to a decline in stock price.

3. **Increasing competition in the electric vehicle market**: The rise of home improvement retailer Home Depot's earnings and sales may indicate a growing demand for electric vehicles, but also increased competition from established players like Volkswagen, which is developing a self-driving electric sedan with a unique twist (no steering wheel).

4. **Strengthening dollar and rising bond yields**: A strengthening dollar and rising bond yields may negatively impact the stock market as a whole, including Tesla's stock price, due to decreased investor appetite for riskier assets.

5. **Rising costs and production challenges**: The auction of 28 billion in 2-year notes by the Treasury Department, which may lead to higher interest rates, could increase the cost of capital for companies like Tesla, making it more expensive to produce electric vehicles and potentially affecting the company's profitability and stock price.

Note that these factors are not exhaustive and may have varying degrees of impact on Tesla's stock price.
