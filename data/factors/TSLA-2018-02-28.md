Based on the provided news, here are the top 5 factors that may affect the stock price of TSLA (Tesla):

1. **Nio's IPO and China's Electric-Car Market Growth**: Nio's plan to go public could lead to increased competition in the Chinese electric-car market, which could negatively impact Tesla's sales and stock price.
2. **Jaguar I-Pace Release and Competition for Luxury EVs**: The release of Jaguar's new electric SUV could increase competition in the luxury EV segment, potentially hurting Tesla's sales and stock price if the I-Pace is successful.
3. **Tesla Model X Performance Concerns**: Consumer Reports' report that some features of the Tesla Model 3 were disappointing could also apply to the Model X, potentially affecting consumer confidence and driving demand for Tesla's products.
4. **Ford Motor Company Stock Performance**: The recent performance of Ford Motor Company stock could impact investor sentiment towards Tesla, as investors may compare and contrast the two companies' automotive strategies and market performance.
5. **Tesla's Innovative Prowess and Elon Musk's Recent Actions**: While Tesla's innovative prowess is generally a positive factor for its stock price, Elon Musk's recent actions (such as launching a Tesla Roadster into orbit) could be perceived as erratic or concerning by some investors, potentially affecting the company's reputation and stock price.

Note that these factors are speculative and may not necessarily affect Tesla's stock price.
