Based on the provided news articles, here are the top 5 factors that may affect the stock price of TSLA (Tesla Inc.):

1. **Commodity Woes: Tariffs on Steel and Aluminum**: The proposed tariffs on steel and aluminum could significantly impact Tesla's production costs, leading to a decrease in stock price. As Tesla relies heavily on these commodities for its vehicles, any increase in prices could affect the company's bottom line.

2. **Tesla's Electric Vehicle Production and Demand**: The strong demand for Tesla's electric vehicles (EVs) has been a significant factor driving up the stock price. However, if there is a decrease in demand or production issues, it could negatively impact the stock price.

3. **Elon Musk's Compensation Package**: The proposed $2.6 billion compensation package for Elon Musk, CEO of Tesla, has received opposition from some shareholders and proxy services. If this issue is not resolved, it could lead to a decrease in investor confidence and affect the stock price.

4. **Trade War with China and Tariffs on Key Commodities**: As mentioned earlier, the proposed tariffs on steel and aluminum could negatively impact Tesla's production costs and the automotive sector as a whole. Additionally, the ongoing trade war between the US and China may lead to further uncertainty and volatility in the market.

5. **Global Economic Uncertainty and Competition from Electric Sportscars**: The increasing competition from electric sportscars, such as those offered by Porsche, Lamborghini, and Aston Martin, could impact Tesla's market share and sales. Additionally, global economic uncertainty and the ongoing pandemic may lead to a decline in consumer confidence, affecting demand for EVs and subsequently impacting the stock price.

Note that these factors are not mutually exclusive, and their combined impact on the stock price of TSLA can be significant.
