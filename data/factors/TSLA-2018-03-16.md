Based on the news articles provided, here are the top 5 factors that may affect the stock price of TSLA (Tesla):

1. **Production and Quality Issues**: Tesla is facing scrutiny over its production of the Model 3 car, with reports suggesting a "high ratio of flawed parts" and vehicles. If this issue persists, it could lead to missed production targets, decreased investor confidence, and potentially harm the company's reputation.

2. **Executive Churn**: Tesla has experienced several high-profile executive departures in recent times. This churn can create uncertainty about the company's direction and leadership, which may impact investor sentiment and stock price.

3. **Competition from Autonomous Vehicles**: The rise of autonomous vehicles is a significant challenge for traditional automakers like Tesla. As companies like Mercedes-Benz invest heavily in self-driving technology, it could erode Tesla's market share and affect its stock price.

4. **Cash Flow and Financial Consequences**: If Tesla fails to meet production targets or faces financial difficulties, it may be forced to reduce costs or even sell off assets. This could lead to a decrease in investor confidence and negatively impact the stock price.

5. **Economic Uncertainty and Global Trade Tensions**: The ongoing global economic uncertainty and trade tensions between countries like the US, China, and the EU can create headwinds for companies like Tesla, which relies heavily on global supply chains and customer demand.

These factors are not exhaustive, but they represent some of the key concerns that could impact Tesla's stock price.
