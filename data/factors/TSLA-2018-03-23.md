I don't see an overview of Elon Musk's early life and education in the text provided. However, I can provide some information on his background.

Elon Musk was born on June 28, 1971, in Pretoria, South Africa. He developed an interest in computing and programming at an early age and taught himself computer programming. He moved to Canada in 1992 to attend college, but he dropped out after two years to pursue a career in technology.

In the late 1990s, Musk co-founded his first company, Zip2, which provided online content publishing software for news organizations. In 1999, Compaq acquired Zip2 for $307 million. Musk then moved to California and co-founded X.com, which later became PayPal. He sold PayPal to eBay in 2002 for $1.5 billion.

Musk's education is as follows:

* Pretoria University High School (1988-1992)
* Queen's University (1992-1994) - studied physics and economics
* University of Pennsylvania (1994-1997) - graduated with a degree in economics
