The article does not explicitly state what Elon Musk joked about, but based on the context, it seems to be related to his electric-car maker going bankrupt. However, he actually joked about Tesla's bankruptcy after sharing some positive news about the company. The joke was likely an April Fools' Day prank.

It is also worth noting that the article mentions a fatal crash investigation involving Tesla's Autopilot system, which caused shares to fall and sparked concerns about the company's safety features. The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) expressed "unhappiness" with Tesla's decision to release information about the crash, suggesting that they needed more cooperation from Tesla to decode the data recorded by the vehicle.
