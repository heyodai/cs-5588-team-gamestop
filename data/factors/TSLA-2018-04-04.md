There is no clear answer to this question as it appears to be a collection of news articles and financial updates related to Tesla, an electric vehicle manufacturer. However, I can try to summarize the key points from these articles:

* Tesla missed its production target for the Model 3 sedan in the first quarter, but Elon Musk reassured investors that the company will hit the 5,000-unit mark by the end of the second quarter.
* Investors are raising bets against Tesla shares due to concerns about the company's ability to churn out the less-expensive Model 3 sedans without raising more cash.
* Despite this, Tesla shares rebounded 6% on Tuesday after promises of progress from Musk and despite a miss in its production target.
* Some analysts, such as Car Lab founder Eric Noble, believe that Tesla should be producing around 10,000 units per month, indicating concerns about the company's production capacity.

Overall, it seems that investors are cautious about Tesla's prospects due to concerns about production capacity and cash burn, but the company is still making efforts to reassure investors about its progress.
