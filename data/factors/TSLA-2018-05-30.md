It appears that there have been some recent incidents involving Tesla vehicles. 

One of the articles reports on a Tesla Model S that crashed into a parked police cruiser in California while its Autopilot system was engaged. The driver suffered minor injuries, but it's unclear whether Autopilot was actually active at the time or if the driver misinterpreted the situation.

Another article discusses Panasonic's plans to develop cobalt-free car batteries, which could help alleviate concerns about the environmental and health impacts of cobalt mining.

Additionally, there are mentions of Tesla's efforts to expand its operations globally, including a potential factory in China and a campaign against regulatory hurdles in India. However, these articles do not provide detailed information on the current status of these initiatives.
