According to an email sent by Elon Musk to Tesla Inc. employees, the CEO responded to a Goldman Sachs analyst's prediction that Tesla will miss estimates with its crucial Model 3 sedan this quarter by saying "They are in for a rude awakening :)". This suggests that Musk is confident that Tesla will exceed expectations and has little concern about missing targets.

The article also mentions that according to Thomson Reuters, 35% of analysts covering Tesla have given the stock "buy" recommendations, while another 35% have recommended "holds", and 30% expect Tesla stock to underperform and have recommended "sells". This indicates a mixed sentiment among analysts regarding the company's prospects.

Additionally, the article mentions that some analysts are questioning whether Model 3 targets are relevant in the grand scheme of things, suggesting that the focus on production targets may not be as critical as other factors such as overall growth and innovation.
