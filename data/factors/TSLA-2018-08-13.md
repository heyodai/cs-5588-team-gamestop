1. **Tesla's valuation**: Eight years after becoming a public company, Tesla's market capitalization per vehicle produced dwarfs all other automakers except Toyota, Volkswagen, Daimler, and BMW.
2. **SEC investigation**: The US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is investigating Tesla due to Musk's proposal to take the company private, including why he announced it on Twitter and whether his statement was truthful.
3. **Saudi Arabia's interest in Tesla buyout**: Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund (PIF) has shown no interest so far in financing Tesla's proposed $72 billion buyout deal, despite acquiring a minority stake in the company this year.
4. **Governance concerns**: Tesla's slow disclosure and Musk's use of social media to announce his plans have raised governance concerns and questions about how companies handle public statements.
5. **Nasdaq's handling of Tesla trading**: Some investors are wondering why Nasdaq allowed trading in Tesla shares to continue for over an hour after Musk announced his buyout plan on Twitter.
6. **Saudi Fund talks Tesla buyout deal**: Saudi Arabia's sovereign wealth fund is in talks that could see it becoming a significant investor in Tesla as part of Elon Musk's plan to take the electric car maker private.
7. **Turkey's economic situation**: Turkey's economy and financial issues are expected to require IMF support, according to Jacob Funk Kirkegaard, senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics.

Overall, these articles suggest that Tesla is under scrutiny from regulatory bodies, investors, and other stakeholders due to its rapid growth and Musk's unconventional communication style.
