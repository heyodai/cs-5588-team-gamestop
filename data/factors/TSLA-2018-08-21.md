Norway's wealth fund, the world's largest sovereign wealth fund, is not taking a stance on Tesla's potential privatization. The Deputy CEO, Trond Grande, stated that rules governing the fund would allow it to stay as an investor in Tesla if it goes private. This indicates that the fund is open to maintaining its investment in Tesla even if the company becomes private, rather than opposing or supporting the move.
