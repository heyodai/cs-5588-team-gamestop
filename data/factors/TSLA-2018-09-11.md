Based on the provided text, it appears that Tesla's leadership has undergone some changes, which may impact its stock price. Specifically:

* Elon Musk has been criticized for his erratic behavior as CEO, including increasing the number of tweets per day, making public outbursts, and taunting short sellers.
* A chief accounting officer recently left the company after less than a month on the job.
* Musk smoked pot during a podcast hosted by a comedian, which caused a brief decline in Tesla's share price.

Additionally, Tesla has made some changes to its production process, including cutting the range of cars offered and removing two paint options to "simplify manufacturing."

Some investors, such as billionaire Trillion-Dollar Investors, have received executive awards that include more than $1 billion if they meet certain financial targets over the next decade. However, it's unclear how these changes will impact Tesla's stock price or its ability to achieve its goals.

It's worth noting that some analysts, like Shah (mentioned in one of the articles), are taking a cautious approach and advising investors to remain on the sidelines until Tesla demonstrates better leadership.
