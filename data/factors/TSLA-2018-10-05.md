Based on the article, here are the main points about Elon Musk's tweets:

* In a tweet on Friday, Tesla CEO Elon Musk announced that the company is delaying the release of Autopilot Drive Mode.
* The tweet was posted after Musk asked Tesla employees to test what he billed as "full self-driving capability" and offered $13,000 in savings to entice them to participate.
* A few days earlier, on Thursday night, Musk tweeted about the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), suggesting that BlackRock and financial firms pocket excessive profits from lending shares they hold to short sellers. He also posted a sarcastic tweet calling the SEC the "Shortseller Enrichment Commission", which led to Tesla's stock price falling.
* The tweets sparked concern among investors and regulators, with some accusing Musk of mocking the SEC again after settling fraud charges with the agency just days earlier.

Overall, it appears that Musk's tweets have caused a stir in the financial markets, with his latest comment about the SEC potentially reigniting tensions between him and the regulator.
