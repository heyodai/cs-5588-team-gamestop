Tesla has secured a land agreement in Shanghai, China for its first overseas Gigafactory. The 860,000 square meter plot was sold at an auction price of 973 million yuan (Â£106.6 million) and marks a key step towards the company's plan to manufacture cars locally in China. This move comes despite ongoing U.S.-China trade tensions, which have caused Tesla to hike prices of its imported models due to tariffs imposed by Beijing on U.S.-made goods.

The agreement is part of Tesla's plans to double its global manufacturing capacity and meet growing demand for electric vehicles in the Chinese market. The company expects the factory to produce its first cars in three years.

Tesla signed a deal with Shanghai authorities in July to build its first factory outside the United States, which would be the company's first overseas Gigafactory. The land agreement is seen as a significant development for Tesla and marks an important milestone in the company's plans to expand its manufacturing capacity globally.
