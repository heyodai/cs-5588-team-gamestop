Based on the news articles provided, here are the top 5 factors that could affect Tesla's stock price:

1. **Profit Fuel Running Out**: UBS analyst Colin Langan argues that Tesla's earnings received some "unexpected help" in the form of a decrease in the company's warranty provision and a large inflow from government credits. However, this is seen as a temporary boost and not a sustainable solution.
2. **Tesla Peaking**: David Einhorn, a short-seller, believes that Tesla's recent share price rally will prove to be short-lived. He thinks that investors have gotten too carried away with Tesla's results and that robust sales of pricier Model 3 sedans are unsustainable.
3. **Government Credits Expired**: The article mentions that the largest boost to Tesla's profits came from the company's sale of government credits that it earned through the production of clean energy products, such as its electric cars. However, this is seen as a one-time benefit and not a sustainable source of revenue.
4. **Competition from Other Automakers**: Elon Musk has little faith that the Big Three will emerge "big" or even "three" from the next economic downturn. He believes that Ford and other automakers will struggle to compete with Tesla's innovative products and services.
5. **Economic Uncertainty**: The article mentions that the dollar fell against major currencies after the U.S.'s midterm election results, and the 10-year benchmark Treasury yield fell three basis points. This economic uncertainty could impact investor confidence in Tesla's stock price.

Note: These factors are not necessarily mutually exclusive, and their impacts on Tesla's stock price may be interconnected or influenced by each other.
