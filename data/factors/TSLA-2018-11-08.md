Tesla has appointed Robyn Denholm, the current CFO of Telstra, as its new chair. She will replace Elon Musk, who agreed to relinquish the chairmanship as part of a settlement with the SEC stemming from bogus tweets he made claiming to have secured financing for a potential Tesla private deal.

Here are the key points:

* Robyn Denholm is an Australian businesswoman and director who has served on Tesla's board since 2014.
* She will be leaving her role as CFO at Telstra in May and until then will relinquish her role as chair of Tesla's audit committee.
* Denholm was chosen to replace Elon Musk, who faces scrutiny over his tweets about taking Tesla private.
* The appointment is effective immediately, and Denholm will focus on Tesla full-time now that she leaves her role at Telstra.
