Based on the provided news articles, here are the top 5 factors that may affect the stock price of TSLA (Tesla Inc.):

1. **Tariff Imposed by China**: Tesla is cutting prices in China in response to tariffs imposed by China on foreign imports. This could impact the company's profit margins and overall financials, potentially affecting its stock price.

2. **Investment in Shanghai Gigafactory**: Tesla announced it will accelerate investment in its first overseas Gigafactory in Shanghai, which will help it avoid steep import tariffs. This development could positively impact the company's growth prospects and stock price.

3. **Oil Prices and Energy Stocks**: Oil prices dived early Friday, sending energy stocks sharply lower. As a major player in the electric vehicle (EV) market, Tesla's stock performance may be influenced by the volatility of oil prices and its potential impact on consumer behavior.

4. **Global Market Trends**: The broader market trends, including the S&P 500 Index's decline of 2.3% month-to-date, may also affect TSLA's stock price. A downturn in the overall market can impact investor sentiment and drive down stock prices.

5. **Competition from NIO**: Tesla faces competition from other Chinese EV manufacturers like NIO, which has seen stellar gains in November. This increased competition could put pressure on Tesla's stock price, especially if it fails to keep up with its competitors' growth rates.

These factors may influence the stock price of TSLA, but it's essential to note that many other market and economic factors can also impact the company's performance.
