General Motors may be shutting down its Canadian plant in Oshawa, Ontario, due to declining demand for pickup trucks. The company is likely to close one of the largest auto production facilities in Oshawa, according to a union report.

Tesla CEO Elon Musk has admitted that the company was near death earlier this year during the Model 3 production ramp-up. He said Tesla was "bleeding money like crazy" and only had "single-digit weeks" left before it would collapse.

General Motors is shifting its focus away from pickup trucks, which are being manufactured in the Oshawa plant, to sedans, according to reports. The models currently being manufactured at the Oshawa plant include:

* Pickup trucks
* Sedans

Note: The specific details of what models are currently being manufactured at the Oshawa plant are not provided in the article.
