Based on the news articles provided, here are the top 5 factors that may affect the stock price of TSLA (Tesla):

1. **Competition from Chinese electric car companies**: China is home to many multibillion-dollar electric car start-ups, and some have launched new passenger vehicles in an effort to capture a share of the market before subsidies end. If these companies are successful, it could lead to increased competition for TSLA in the Chinese market.

2. **Price cuts due to tariff reductions**: Tesla has reduced the prices of two models in China following the reduction of tariffs on imported goods. This is likely to increase the affordability of these vehicles in the country and may boost sales.

3. **Increased production and revenue**: Tesla's record-high production levels and profit in Q3 2018 were positive indicators for the company. If TSLA can maintain or improve these numbers, it could lead to an increase in investor confidence and a boost in stock price.

4. **Elon Musk's management style and controversies**: As mentioned in some of the news articles, Elon Musk's behavior and management style have been a subject of controversy. Any further controversies or issues with his leadership could negatively impact TSLA's stock price.

5. **Government subsidies for electric vehicles**: The government-supported market for electric vehicles is expected to continue growing, and TSLA will need to navigate this changing landscape to remain competitive. If the government subsidies end or are reduced, it could lead to a decline in sales and revenue for TSLA.
