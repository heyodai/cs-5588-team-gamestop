Based on the news articles, here are the top 5 factors that may affect the stock price of TSLA:

1. **Safety concerns and defective batteries**: The recent lawsuit filed against Tesla due to a passenger's death in a crash caused by a defective battery has raised concerns about the safety of Tesla's vehicles. This could lead to a decline in investor confidence and a drop in the stock price.

2. **Competition from Nissan's new Leaf EV**: The release of Nissan's more powerful Leaf EV model, which narrows the driving-range gap with Tesla's Model 3 and General Motors' Chevrolet Bolt, may put pressure on Tesla's market share. This could lead to a decline in sales and revenue for Tesla, negatively impacting its stock price.

3. **Elon Musk's comments about the next CEO**: Elon Musk's statement that the next CEO of Tesla could be Chinese has raised concerns among investors. If Musk is unable to find a suitable replacement or if there are tensions between him and potential candidates, it could impact Tesla's leadership and governance, leading to a decline in investor confidence.

4. **Negative sentiment and short interest**: The moderate bearish sentiment and high short interest of 10-15% of shares outstanding indicate that some investors have become pessimistic about the stock's future performance. This could lead to a decline in the stock price as more investors join the bears.

5. **ETF inflows and market trends**: Despite Tesla's gains, the company still lags behind other stocks like Facebook, Boeing, and General Motors, which are performing well in premarket trade. If Tesla fails to catch up with these peers, it may continue to lag behind, leading to a decline in investor confidence and a drop in its stock price.

Note that these factors are not exhaustive, and there may be other news articles or events that could affect the stock price of TSLA.
