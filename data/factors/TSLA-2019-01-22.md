Here's a summary of the article:

Tesla Inc. has held talks with China's Tianjin Lishen to supply batteries for its new Shanghai factory, but no agreement has been reached yet. According to two people with direct knowledge of the matter, Tesla and Lishen have signed a preliminary agreement, but the details are still being worked out. The companies have not decided on the size of the order, and Lishen is still determining the battery cell size required for Tesla's vehicles.

However, Tesla has denied signing a preliminary agreement with Lishen, stating that it had received quotes from the Chinese battery maker but did not proceed further. Tesla CEO Elon Musk referred to the production challenges faced by Model 3 as "production hell," but manufacturing improvements were seen in the second half of last year.

In other news, Hyperloop Transportation Technologies' first commercial lines are expected to open to the public by 2022, according to its CEO. The company's first commercial lines will use magnets to levitate and propel pods through large tubes at speeds comparable to that of an airline.

Additionally, China's Tianjin Lishen denied signing a preliminary agreement with Tesla, saying it had not reached any agreement on supplying batteries for the U.S. electric vehicle maker's Shanghai factory.

Overall, it seems that there is some confusion around the status of Tesla's battery supply talks with Lishen, but both parties have denied signing an agreement and are working on the details.
