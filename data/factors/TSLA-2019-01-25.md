The article discusses Overstock's (OSTK) struggles in launching a cryptocurrency platform at a time when interest in cryptocurrencies is waning. The author compares Overstock unfavorably to DeLorean, a car manufacturer that failed to capitalize on its innovative technology before it was too late.

The author suggests that if Overstock had launched its platform two years ago, it might have been able to ride the crypto wave to success. Instead, it has entered the market at a time when no one cares about cryptocurrencies, making it difficult for the company to gain traction.

The article also notes that Overstock's retail business is not going anywhere, and management's failure to strike while the iron was hot means that they should have avoided launching the platform altogether.

However, the author acknowledges that blockchain technology remains relevant and viable, even in a downturn. They predict that if bitcoin and other digital assets start moving higher, OSTK stock price may rise in solidarity.

Overall, the article concludes that Overstock is a poorly managed organization associated with a groundbreaking platform, but its prospects are uncertain at best.
