This appears to be an article about Tesla's acquisition of Maxwell Technologies, a company that develops electric batteries. Here are the main points:

**Summary**

Tesla has agreed to acquire Maxwell Technologies in an all-stock deal worth $218 million. The acquisition is valued at 55% premium to Maxwell's Friday closing price of $3.07.

**Details**

* Tesla will exchange each share of Maxwell for a fraction of Tesla shares, which will be valued at $4.75.
* The deal values Maxwell shares at $4.75, making it a significant premium over the company's previous closing price.
* Maxwell has about 45.9 million shares outstanding, and the bid implies a market capitalization of $217.9 million for Tesla.

**Context**

The acquisition is seen as part of Tesla's efforts to bolster its electric capabilities and improve its battery technology. Panasonic, which also manufactures batteries for Tesla, reported a significant drop in profit due to slowing demand in China, but its energy division (which includes the battery business with Tesla) posted an operating profit for the first time in three quarters.

**Financials**

* Tesla's stock price slipped 0.1% in premarket trade.
* Maxwell Technologies' stock was halted for news.
* Panasonic's earnings were impacted by a slower-than-expected demand for home appliances and factory automation equipment in China, with the company cutting its full-year earnings outlook.

Overall, this acquisition is seen as an important move by Tesla to improve its electric capabilities and compete in the growing battery market.
