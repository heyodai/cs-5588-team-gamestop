Based on the provided news, here are the top 5 factors that may affect the stock price of TSLA:

1. **Autopilot Disabling in Europe**: Tesla's Model 3 will have autopilot disabled in Europe due to regulatory requirements, which may negatively impact investor sentiment and lead to a decrease in TSLA's stock price (down 1.2% pre-market).
2. **Gigafactory 3 Plans Uncertainty**: The planned Gigafactory 3 in Shanghai is facing uncertainty, which may raise concerns about Tesla's production capacity and volume growth, potentially affecting the company's stock price.
3. **Amazon's Investment in Aurora**: Amazon's $530 million investment in Aurora, a self-driving technology startup, may lead to increased competition in the autonomous vehicle space, potentially impacting TSLA's stock price.
4. **Baillie Gifford's Increased Stake**: Baillie Gifford's slight increase in its stake in Tesla from 7.64% to 7.71% indicates a positive sentiment towards the company, but may also be seen as a bullish indicator that could drive up TSLA's stock price.
5. **Outflows of Investor Capital in ETFs**: The outflows of investor capital in ETFs holding TSLA totaling $3.89 billion over the last one-month suggests a bearish sentiment among investors seeking to profit from falling equity prices, which may lead to a decrease in TSLA's stock price.
