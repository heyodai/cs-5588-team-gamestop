The article argues that recent job cuts at Tesla are actually a positive development for the company's stock price. The author believes that Tesla is right-sizing its operations to continue driving EV prices down, which will lead to broader vehicle adoption, bigger sales, and bigger profits. This, in turn, will boost Tesla stock.

The article highlights several points that support this argument:

1. Job cuts are not a sign of declining demand or popularity for Tesla products.
2. The company is cutting costs to lower prices, which will supercharge demand and broaden customer reach.
3. Lower prices will drive revenues higher, gross margins remain stable, and profits soar.
4. The market's reaction to job cuts is irrational and based on a short-term view.
5. Tesla is pioneering a global EV revolution that will eventually lead to widespread adoption and profitability.

The author also notes that Tesla has a long-term growth narrative, with potential for 2 million annual deliveries, $115 billion in annual revenues, and $10 billion-plus in net profits, which could lead to a market cap of over $200 billion.

Overall, the article presents a bullish view on Tesla's stock price, arguing that job cuts are a positive development for the company's long-term prospects.
