Based on the provided news articles, here are the top 5 factors that could impact Tesla's (and therefore also Rivian's) stock price:

1. **Billionaire Stanley Druckenmiller's bet against Tesla**: Druckenmiller's hedge fund has bought put options on Tesla shares worth $99.8 million (Â£77.9 million), indicating a bearish stance on the company's future performance.
2. **Tesla's executive exodus**: The mass exodus of Tesla executives in the last 12 months may raise concerns about the company's leadership and direction, potentially affecting its stock price.
3. **Amazon's investment in Rivian**: Amazon's potential investment in Rivian could have a positive impact on the electric pickup truck maker's stock price, as it would provide a major endorsement and likely drive up demand for Rivian's products.
4. **Cybersecurity threats to the automotive industry**: The growing concern about cybersecurity threats to the automotive industry, including Tesla, may lead investors to be more cautious about investing in companies that rely heavily on technology and connectivity.
5. **Competition from established players**: The emergence of new competitors, such as Sonnen (a German battery start-up acquired by Shell) and potential investments from major companies like Apple, may increase competition for Rivian's electric pickup truck business, potentially affecting its market share and stock price.

These factors could contribute to a bearish sentiment towards Tesla and Rivian's stocks, while Amazon's investment in Rivian could provide a boost. However, the overall impact of these events on their respective stock prices would depend on various market and economic factors.
