Tesla has started delivering Model 3 cars in China slightly ahead of schedule, as it aims to revive its sales that have been hit hard by Sino-U.S. trade tensions. The company had initially projected a March start for Model 3 deliveries in China, but has begun deliveries earlier than expected. Tesla has adjusted prices and added a cheaper Model 3 variant to its line-up to make its U.S.-made cars more affordable in China amid high import tariffs.

Additionally, Tesla's Model 3 sedan lost its "recommended" status from Consumer Reports due to issues with loose body trim and glass defects. The company is still working to improve the quality of its vehicles as it ramps up production.

Overall, it appears that Tesla is making efforts to revive its sales in China and improve the quality of its vehicles. However, the company still faces challenges related to its production and regulatory environment.
