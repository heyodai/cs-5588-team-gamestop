Here's a summary of the article:

The US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is seeking to hold Tesla CEO Elon Musk in contempt of court over a tweet he made on February 19, which was later corrected to say that deliveries would only reach around 400,000 electric vehicles this year. The SEC alleges that Musk violated an agreement reached with the agency last year, which required him to seek pre-approval from Tesla's top lawyer before posting material information about the company on Twitter.

Musk had previously tweeted that Tesla would make around 500,000 electric vehicles this year, but later corrected himself after receiving criticism. The SEC is seeking a court order to hold Musk in contempt for violating the settlement, which could result in fines and other penalties.

The incident has sparked renewed debate about whether Musk's tweets are reckless and misleading to investors. Tesla shareholders have expressed concerns that Musk's tweeting habits are a risk factor for the company.

The article also mentions that this is not the first time Musk has been involved in a controversy with the SEC over his tweets. In 2018, Musk agreed to pay $20 million and step down as Tesla's chairman after he tweeted about taking the company private without approval from investors.

Overall, the incident highlights the ongoing tension between Musk's desire for transparency and his willingness to use social media to communicate directly with his followers, which can sometimes be at odds with regulatory requirements.
