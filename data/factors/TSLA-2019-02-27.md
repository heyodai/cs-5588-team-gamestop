The article discusses the ongoing battle between Tesla CEO Elon Musk and the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). The SEC has asked a federal judge to hold Musk in contempt for violating the terms of his settlement with the agency. The settlement required Tesla to scrutinize all of Musk's Twitter messages that might affect the company's stock, including predicting how many cars Tesla might make in a year.

The article notes that Musk's recent tweets were seen as a violation of this condition, and the SEC is seeking to hold him in contempt for failing to seek approval before publishing the tweets. The judge has ordered Musk to respond to the SEC's motion by March 11, giving him time to address the allegations and potentially avoid being held in contempt.

The article also mentions that Musk had previously criticized the SEC as "broken" in a recent tweet, which may have further antagonized the agency. However, the article notes that public companies are accountable for financial reporting, and the US is generally more tolerant of its founders and early CEOs than the UK, where they are often ousted by a more steady pair of hands.

Overall, the article suggests that Musk's Twitter behavior is a key factor in the SEC's decision to seek contempt charges against him. The SEC is seeking to hold Musk accountable for his actions and ensure that Tesla complies with its settlement agreement.
