This article discusses Tesla's announcement that it will begin selling its vehicles exclusively online, starting with the $35,000 Model 3 sedan. Here are the main points:

1. **Tesla to sell cars online only**: The company is making a significant shift away from traditional retail sales models, citing the need to cut costs and increase demand.
2. **Price reduction**: Tesla is finally offering its mass-market Model 3 sedan for $35,000, down from previous prices of over $50,000.
3. **Loss in first quarter**: CEO Elon Musk warned that Tesla will not turn a profit in the first quarter due to increased competition and market volatility.
4. **Online-only sales strategy**: The move is part of Tesla's efforts to become more efficient and competitive, with Musk stating, "It's 2019, people just want to buy things online."
5. **Store closures**: Many Tesla stores will be closed as the company focuses on online sales, but some will remain open as galleries or information centers in high-traffic areas.
6. **Impact on U.S. car dealers**: The move is likely to further rile U.S. car dealers who have fought against Tesla's direct-to-consumer sales model.

Overall, Tesla's decision to sell its cars online only is seen as a bold move to cut costs and increase demand, but it also raises concerns about the impact on traditional retail sales models and the company's ability to generate profits in the short term.
