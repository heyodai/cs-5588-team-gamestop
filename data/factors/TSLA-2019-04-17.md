The article discusses the recent predictions made by David Einhorn, a hedge fund manager, that Tesla's shares are headed for new lows. Einhorn believes that Tesla is in trouble due to lack of demand, price cuts, layoffs, service center closings, and cuts to capital expenditures. He also compares Tesla to Lehman Brothers, suggesting that the company's path is doomed.

However, some investors have taken a different view, citing the big picture on the price chart of Tesla stock, which suggests that shares may have a "full house" and are worthy of bullish investors wagering long on shares today. Einhorn's firm, Greenlight Capital, has been short TSLA stock for over three years and has not had much success with this bet.

The article also mentions that if Tesla's earnings report is delivered as planned next week, the company may be able to turn around its fortunes. Additionally, Volkswagen plans to build a fully electric sports utility vehicle (SUV) for China from 2021, taking on Tesla's Model X in the Chinese market.

Overall, the article suggests that while Einhorn's predictions may be accurate, there are still many factors at play that could impact Tesla's future performance.
