The article discusses the challenges facing Tesla's stock and the reasons why some investors are cutting back on their exposure to the company.

**Key Points:**

1. **Slowing growth:** Needham analyst Gill forecasts just 15% revenue growth for Tesla in 2020, a significant decline from previous years.
2. **Lower margins:** The lower-cost Model 3s are eating into Tesla's gross margins, which are expected to drop to 19.5% this year.
3. **Production challenges:** Bank of America analyst John Murphy notes that Tesla faces production and logistics challenges on the Model S/X and potentially new ones in Europe and China.
4. **Cash burn:** Tesla continues to burn through cash, with Needham expecting a decline in net cash position by $2 billion in Q1.
5. **High valuation:** Tesla's stock trades at a high forward price-earnings multiple of 217 and 55.5 for 2019 and 2020, respectively.

**Why the Challenges?**

The article suggests that Tesla faces several challenges, including:

1. **Slowing demand:** The elimination of the electric-vehicle tax credit has pulled demand forward to Q4 of 2018.
2. **Logistical issues:** Tesla's overseas-expansion efforts are facing logistical challenges.
3. **Model 3 delays:** Model 3 deliveries have been slower than expected, and production ramps up are being delayed.
4. **CEO Twitter controversies:** Elon Musk's tweets can be controversial and affect investor confidence.

**What Does This Mean for Investors?**

The article concludes that Tesla's stock is not a growth name anymore, at least not for the next two years. With slowing growth, shrinking margins, logistical issues, and high valuation, investors may want to take a closer look at other stocks with more sustainable growth prospects.
