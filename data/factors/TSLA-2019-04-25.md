Panasonic may upgrade one of its battery plants in Japan to produce advanced-format battery cells for Tesla Inc, according to a source familiar with the matter. This could be necessary if Tesla needs additional battery supply, particularly for its Model 3 sedan. The Japanese plant produces cylindrical lithium-ion "18650" cells used in Tesla's Model S and Model X vehicles, while the Nevada plant produces higher-energy density "2170" cells.
