Based on the news articles provided, here are the top 5 factors that may affect the stock price of TSLA (Tesla):

1. **Trade War with China**: The ongoing trade war between the US and China has a significant impact on Tesla's stock price, particularly due to the tariffs imposed on Chinese goods. A higher tariff rate would increase the cost of importing raw materials, which could negatively affect Tesla's profit margins.
2. **Escalating US-China Relations**: President Trump's criticism of China on Twitter and the subsequent announcement by China of a retaliatory move against US goods could further escalate tensions between the two countries. This could lead to increased uncertainty and volatility in the market, potentially affecting Tesla's stock price.
3. **VW's Electric Vehicle Capacity Expansion**: Volkswagen AG's plans to build new electric car plants in China to overtake Tesla's capacity may reduce demand for Tesla's vehicles, leading to a decrease in its stock price.
4. **Rare Earth Minerals Tariffs**: The tariffs imposed on rare earth minerals from the US could affect Tesla's production costs and profit margins, particularly if it relies heavily on these materials for its electric vehicles.
5. **Safety Concerns and Regulatory Issues**: The recent incident of a Tesla car catching fire in Hong Kong and the concerns surrounding safety and regulatory issues may impact investor confidence and lead to a decline in Tesla's stock price.

Note that these factors are not exhaustive, and other news articles may also have an impact on Tesla's stock price.
