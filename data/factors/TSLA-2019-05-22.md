Morgan Stanley has set a bear case scenario for Tesla's stock, predicting that its shares could plummet to $10. However, Citi analyst Itay Michaeli has taken this idea even further, forecasting that Tesla's shares could drop as low as $36. This prediction is based on the company's substantial cash burn and significant debt load.

Other analysts have also expressed concerns about Tesla's financial health, with some predicting a worse-case scenario for the stock. Schaeffer's Investment Research has identified a "shocking bear base" for Tesla Inc., which could lead to a significant decline in its shares.

The prediction of a worst-case scenario for Tesla's stock is part of a broader trend of pessimism about the company's prospects. Despite its growth and innovation, Tesla has faced numerous challenges, including intense competition from established automakers, regulatory hurdles, and production issues.

The bear case scenario for Tesla's stock highlights the risks associated with investing in the company. It also underscores the importance of staying informed and up-to-date on market trends and analyst predictions.
