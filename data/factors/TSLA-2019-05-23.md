There are several potential negative trends or concerns mentioned in the article that could impact consumer behavior or investor sentiment:

1. Potential for a U.S.-China trade war: The Commerce Ministry's statement suggests that China may take action to protect its firms if the US increases tariffs on Chinese goods, which could lead to higher prices and reduced demand for U.S. goods.
2. Decline in Tesla stock: Analysts are painting a bleak picture of Tesla's future, which could lead to a decline in investor confidence and reduced demand for Tesla products.
3. Economic recession fears: The Commerce Ministry's statement also mentions the risk of a global economic recession, which could lead to reduced consumer spending and investment in electric vehicles.
4. Disappointment with new stocks: Nio stock is mentioned as being down more than 30% from its IPO price, which suggests that investors may be losing confidence in the company's prospects.

These concerns could potentially impact consumer behavior or investor sentiment, leading to a potential boycott of U.S. goods or reduced investment in electric vehicle manufacturers.
