Based on the articles, here's a summary of the risks to consider before investing in NIO stock:

1. **No efficiencies**: Nio outsources its manufacturing to JAC, which means it doesn't benefit from economies of scale as it scales up.
2. **No moat**: Nio lacks a competitive advantage in the market, which makes it harder for the company to maintain profitability and grow sustainably.
3. **Valuation concerns**: Nio's valuation is high, with a price-to-sales ratio of 5.7X, and the company continues to lose money.
4. **Dilution risk**: With major backers like Tencent, Nio may need to do another capital raise, which could lead to further dilution of ownership.
5. **Burn rate concerns**: As Nio scales up, its burn rate (losses) is likely to increase, making it harder for the company to achieve profitability.

Additionally, investors should consider the following market trends and events:

1. **Tesla's China-made Model 3 prices**: The final price of Tesla's China-made Model 3 may be in the range of $43,400-$50,700.
2. **Analyst calls**: Various analysts have made predictions about Nio stock, with some calling it a buy and others warning about its high valuation and burn rate concerns.

It's essential to conduct thorough research and consider multiple perspectives before making any investment decisions.
