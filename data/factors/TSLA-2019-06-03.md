Based on the provided news articles, here are the top 5 factors that may affect the stock price of TSLA:

1. **Demand for vehicles**: Concerns about demand for Tesla's vehicles have been increasing, which has led to a decline in the company's stock price. The article mentions that investors are worried about weak orders and competition from rival electric-car maker Tesla (Telsa Inc.). A decrease in demand could lead to a reduction in sales and revenue, negatively impacting the company's stock price.

2. **Financial health**: The article states that Tesla has been under pressure from Wall Street due to concerns about the company's financial health. This includes issues with capital expenditures, production schedules, technology, and profitability targets. A decline in the company's financial health could lead to a decrease in investor confidence, causing the stock price to drop.

3. **Lithium supply**: The article mentions that Australia and Chile are looking to increase their lithium supplies to meet growing demand from electric vehicle manufacturers. This could lead to higher costs for Tesla and other companies that rely on lithium for their products, negatively impacting their profit margins and stock prices.

4. **Regulatory compliance**: Tesla's sales of plug-in hybrid Chevrolet Volts and all-electric Chevy Bolts may have left GM and Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV in a difficult situation regarding regulatory compliance. The article states that GM and Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV reached agreements to buy federal greenhouse gas credits from Tesla, which could impact the company's stock price due to increased costs.

5. **Production challenges**: The article mentions that Tesla's Fremont factory has received repeated notices of violations and permit deviations, and its paint shop has been dogged by technical problems, fires, and poor record-keeping. This could lead to production delays, increased costs, and a negative impact on the company's stock price due to reduced investor confidence.

These factors can contribute to volatility in Tesla's stock price, which has already experienced significant fluctuations recently.
