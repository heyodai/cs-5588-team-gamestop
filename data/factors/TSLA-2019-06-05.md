The article discusses the prospects for Tesla stock, currently trading below $200 per share. The author suggests that while Tesla is going through a rough patch, the company's fundamental value and growth potential make it an attractive investment opportunity.

One possible scenario is that a large automotive conglomerate like Volkswagen could acquire Tesla, but this seems unlikely according to analyst Max Warburton of Bernstein. Instead, tech companies like Apple may be interested in acquiring Tesla, which could provide a well-financed partner for Elon Musk's company.

ARK Invest CEO Catherine Wood believes that there is an "amazing inefficiency" in Tesla stock, making it a high conviction idea. She predicts that the stock will hit $200 by the end of 2019, although this target may be optimistic given the current challenges facing the company.

The article also mentions that some financial analysts have questioned ARK Invest's calculations for Tesla's market capitalization, citing errors in their projections. However, it is unclear whether these errors are significant enough to alter the author's overall assessment of Tesla's value and potential.

Overall, the article presents a cautiously optimistic view of Tesla stock, highlighting its potential growth opportunities and the possibility of a well-financed partner for Elon Musk's company.
