The article discusses Plug Power, a company that is developing fuel cell vehicles (FCV) with hydrogen power. Despite the advantages of FCV technology, such as range anxiety being eliminated, the company's stock price has been affected by various factors.

**Key Points:**

1. **Range Anxiety:** FCV-powered cars have an advantage over battery-powered electric cars in terms of range and refueling time.
2. **Infrastructure:** The lack of cheap refueling options and public infrastructure is a major obstacle to the widespread adoption of FCV technology.
3. **Cost:** Hydrogen-powered electric vehicles are more expensive to fuel than traditional cars, making them less competitive in the market.
4. **Tesla's Impact:** Tesla's dominance in the electric car market has led to Plug Power's stock price being affected, with some analysts even mocking FCV technology as "fool's cells."
5. **Commercial Opportunities:** Despite these challenges, Plug Power sees opportunities in commercial fleets, such as delivery trucks and forklifts.
6. **New Development:** The company is launching a new ProGen 30kW engine aimed at fleets of delivery trucks, which could be a key to unlocking its growth potential.

**Investment Insights:**

1. **Stock Price:** Plug Power's stock price has had a rough road, but it may have bottomed out, with some analysts predicting a significant increase in value if the company can successfully expand into commercial fleets.
2. **Comparison to Tesla:** Plug Power's stock price is compared to Tesla's, highlighting the competition between electric car manufacturers.
3. **China's Role:** China is seen as a major player in the global electric vehicle market, with plans to construct 20 towns focused on EV production.

**Conclusion:**

While FCV technology has its advantages, the lack of infrastructure and high fuel costs make it challenging for Plug Power to compete with battery-powered electric cars. However, the company's focus on commercial fleets and new development opportunities may help it overcome these challenges.
