* The author believes that TSLA stock is overpriced and not justified by the company's performance.

* The author also mentions concerns about Tesla's capital spending, which has been declining, and the challenges facing the energy business, including plunging revenues and a lack of progress on the solar roof project.
* Additionally, the author notes that Elon Musk has a history of making unrealistic promises, including his predictions for "robotaxis" and full self-driving vehicles, which have raised skepticism among investors.
* The author concludes that TSLA stock may be due for a correction, but believes that the company could still sell itself if execution doesn't improve or growth disappoints.

Overall, the author's stance is bearish on TSLA stock, with a strong expectation of downside risk in the near term.
