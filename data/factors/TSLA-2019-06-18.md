Tesla's stock price has been volatile in recent weeks, with a significant decline between May 6 and June 3. The company's next earnings statement is expected in late July, which may provide more insight into its business model and potential for turnaround. Investors are watching closely to see if Tesla can stay above $220, a psychologically important level.

As of now, the risk/reward ratio on the long side seems inadequate, making it a speculative bet. The company's senior team is likely having honest discussions about potential issues, but more information will be needed before committing capital.

In summary:

*   Tesla's stock price has been volatile.
*   The next earnings statement in late July may provide more insight into the company's business model and potential for turnaround.
*   Investors are watching closely to see if Tesla can stay above $220.
