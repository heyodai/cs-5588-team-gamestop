The article discusses the vulnerability of Tesla's Autopilot system to GPS spoofing attacks and how it was successfully spoofed by Regulus Cyber in a test conducted last year. The attack relied on placing an antenna on the car itself, which is unlikely to happen without notice from the driver.

However, experts say that the impact of the attack was limited, as the Tesla Model 3 did not crash but instead braked and took a different route. This is because Tesla's onboard computer uses multiple sensors, including GPS, radar, maps, and cameras, to funnel data into a central processing unit, where a final driving decision is made.

Additionally, researchers have concluded that any patch for a spoofing risk will likely involve those other sensors, making it less feasible for an attacker to successfully spoof the system.

The article also notes that systems like Autopilot are not fully autonomous but rather driving assistance, and drivers need to be aware and capable of taking over.
