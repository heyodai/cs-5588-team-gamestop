The article discusses the electric vehicle (EV) company Energy Absolute, which has partnered with taxi unions to order 3,500 cars for metropolitan Bangkok. The EVs are designed and built in Thailand and can travel up to 200 kilometers on a single charge. This is less than some of its competitors, but still attractive to the taxi unions, who expect to save money on fuel costs.

The company plans to use lithium-ion batteries from a new factory being built in Thailand, which could catapult the country into third place globally in production. Energy Absolute aims to integrate all stages of the EV life cycle, including electricity generation and charging-point installation, similar to Tesla Inc.

Thailand is one of the most advanced countries in Southeast Asia when it comes to offering incentives for EV manufacturers and reducing taxes on sales of their cars. The country offers corporate tax breaks for eight years, exemptions from import duties on machinery and parts, and reductions in excise taxes.

Despite this support, the article notes that there is still a long road ahead for Thailand to reach its goals in terms of EV adoption. China is projected to sell triple the number of passenger EVs every day this year, according to BloombergNEF calculations. Energy Absolute's goal is to introduce EV cars to the Thai market and expand to nearby countries such as Indonesia, Vietnam, Malaysia, and the Philippines.

The company plans to have at least one charging point every five kilometers around Bangkok and aims to install another 300 charging stations this year. They also plan to launch three new EV models, including a midsize model, a cheaper compact car, and a pricier sports car.
