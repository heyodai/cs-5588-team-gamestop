The article discusses the volatility and uncertainty surrounding Tesla's stock price. Despite being one of the most followed stocks, Tesla's shares have been highly unpredictable, with prices often oscillating between bullish and bearish sentiment.

Some analysts, such as Jefferies, believe that the negative sentiment around Tesla is "excessive" and that the company has significant value despite its current challenges. Jefferies cut their price target for Tesla from $400 to $300 per share, but still recommends buying the stock.

On the other hand, some analysts, such as R.W. Baird, are more optimistic about Tesla's prospects and have raised their price target from $340 to $355 per share. They expect the stock to react positively to quarterly delivery numbers in July, which have been underwhelming due to concerns about demand.

The article also mentions a former Foolish favorite that has been rising while Tesla fell, suggesting that there may be other stocks that are less volatile and more promising for investors.
