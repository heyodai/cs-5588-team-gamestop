Tesla's CEO Elon Musk has set a ambitious target of delivering over 500,000 vehicles in the second quarter of 2023. However, it seems that not all of his employees are as optimistic about the company's prospects.

Peter Hochholdinger, the head of production at Tesla's factory in Fremont, California, has left the company after three years with Tesla. Hochholdinger was hired by Tesla in 2016 from Audi, where he spent 22 years supervising the production of Audi A4, A5, and Q5 models.

This departure comes as a significant blow to Tesla, which is struggling to ramp up production of its Model 3 sedan. The company's delivery numbers have been under pressure in recent months, and Musk has been pushing hard for his team to meet their targets.

Despite the challenges, Musk remains confident that Tesla can achieve its ambitious goals. In an internal email, he wrote that the company already has enough vehicle orders to set a record, but logistics and final delivery are still a challenge.

Analysts have also expressed skepticism about Tesla's prospects, with some predicting that the company's shares could fall in the coming months. The U.S. federal tax credit for electric vehicles is scheduled to decrease from $3,750 to $1,875 as of July 1, which could make it harder for Tesla to maintain its momentum.

In response to a Twitter question about his birthday plans, Musk wrote that he was "working on Tesla global logistics."
