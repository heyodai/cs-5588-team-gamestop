I'm not a search engine, but I can provide some information on the topics you mentioned. However, it seems like there is no specific question or topic to answer. The text appears to be an article from Bloomberg about various technology and business news.

If you'd like, I can try to summarize the main points of the article or provide more context about the topics mentioned, such as driverless cars, Tesla's battery technology, or trade wars between the US and China. Let me know how I can assist you!
