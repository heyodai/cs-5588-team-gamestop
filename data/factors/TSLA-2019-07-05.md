The article discusses Plug Power (PLUG) stock and its potential for growth. Here are the key points:

1. **Strong Q2 guidance**: Plug Power announced that it would deploy about 2,000 fuel cells during Q2, which could lead to a strong earnings report.
2. **Positive outlook**: The company expects to meet its full-year revenue guidance of between $235 million and $245 million and report positive 2019 EBITDA.
3. **Fuel cells gaining interest**: Despite the focus on solar power and battery-powered electric cars, fuel cells are becoming increasingly popular in smaller vehicles used in industry.
4. **Investment from Amazon**: In 2017, Amazon invested $600 million in Plug Power, which helped boost its stock price.
5. **Acquisitions and partnerships**: Plug Power has received orders for its products from Walmart (WMT) and GE (GE), and recently acquired EnergyOr, which should enable the company to generate meaningful revenue from makers of robotics and unmanned aircraft.
6. **Growing market potential**: The fuel cell market is expected to grow to $3.48 billion by 2025, representing a 13% compound annual growth rate.
7. **Competitors**: Plug Power's competitors, such as Ballard Power Systems (BLDP) and Bloom Energy (BE), are also well-positioned to benefit from the growing market.

However, the article also notes that:

1. **PLUG stock remains speculative**: Despite its recent performance, PLUG stock is still considered a speculative investment.
2. **Dilution of shares**: The number of shares outstanding has risen significantly since 2011, which could reduce the potential for a stratospheric rally like the one in the late 1990s.
3. **No new customers or acquisitions have significantly affected PLUG stock price**: Despite its relationship with Amazon, neither prominent new customers nor acquisitions have had a significant impact on PLUG stock price.

Overall, the article concludes that while Plug Power has potential for growth, its stock remains speculative and should be approached with caution. Investors who are considering buying PLUG stock should do so with a long-term perspective and be prepared for volatility.
