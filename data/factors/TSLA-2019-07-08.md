The article discusses Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg's reputation and how it is perceived by the company's employees. According to a presentation from June 2017, Zuckerberg was rated on various personality attributes such as "mature", "honest", and "passionate". He scored highest on "innovative" but lowest on "shares my values".

The presentation also charted Zuckerberg against rival CEOs, including Bill Gates, who was considered the most "well-known, well-liked" person. The slide suggested that Zuckerberg's reputation had evolved over time, with Gates' arc from a scrutinized tech founder to a marquee philanthropist serving as a comparison.

Zuckerberg took issue with a particular slide that focused on innovation, feeling that it was a knock on himself and Facebook's reputation for creativity. The presentation was presented to him in his glass conference room, known as the Aquarium, but he ultimately did not focus on these issues.

The article also mentions that former Facebook Chief Marketing Officer Gary Briggs instituted these surveys after joining the company in 2013. He believed that Zuckerberg's reputation would influence Facebook's and vice versa. The research was aimed at convincing him to focus more on his own reputation and improving both Facebook's and his own.

Overall, the presentation provides a rare glimpse into Facebook's internal priorities and what its employees think about top executives. It highlights the challenges of maintaining a positive public image while navigating complex issues such as innovation and philanthropy.
