So, according to RBC Capital analyst Joseph Spak, even though Ford and Tesla have reported positive sales numbers, the overall outlook for the automotive industry remains bearish. Here are some key points from his analysis:

1. **Sales decline**: Spak expects June car sales in North America to be down 2% compared to April sales figures, and down 2.8% year over year.
2. **European sales**: European sales in June are expected to be stable compared to April, but still down 7% year over year.
3. **Chinese sales**: Western carmakers' sales in China are expected to decline by 16% year over year.
4. **H2 2019 forecast**: Spak believes the global automotive recession will extend into Q2 2020, with a decline of about 1.2% in car production.
5. **Ford and Tesla analysis**:
	* Ford's Q2 earnings are expected to be $0.03 below consensus estimates, at about $0.28 per share.
	* Despite this miss, Spak expects investors will forgive Ford if it gives better guidance than what the analyst expects.
	* Tesla's Q2 results were "contentious," and Spak warns that investors should not get too excited about the company's sales beat, as it may have sacrificed profitability for units.

Overall, Spak's analysis is bearish on both Ford and Tesla, despite their positive sales announcements. He expects a decline in car production and sales in the second half of 2019, and believes that demand has been a negative for Tesla for a long time.
