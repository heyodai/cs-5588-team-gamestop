A Tesla owner is seeking a refund for his $50,000 Model 3 after purchasing it just last month. The owner had visited his local dealership to demand a refund due to some concerns with the vehicle. He reported that he had received a free wall charger as an apology, but this did not suffice.

The incident highlights the challenges Tesla faces in terms of customer satisfaction and the brand's reputation for quality and reliability.
