This text appears to be an analysis report from a financial analyst, Gill, who has Downgraded Tesla (TSLA) stock to Sell. The main points of his bearish outlook are:

1. Competition: Tesla's edge in neural network training for its Full Self-Driving Computer (FSD) technology may not last long as other companies like Toyota and Volvo are developing similar capabilities.
2. Demand: Tesla's high delivery figures in Q2 were partly due to customers accelerating purchases before the U.S. federal tax credit expired, which bears believe will not be repeated.
3. Gross Margin: The company's gross margin has come under pressure from declining sales of higher-margin Model S/X and aggressive pricing.
4. Long-term profitability: Tesla's ability to sustain long-term profitability is uncertain due to its focus on growth at the expense of margins.

Gill projects:

* Further price cuts and aggressive leasing plans to meet 360-400k delivery targets for 2019
* Negative earnings throughout 2019 and limited earnings power in FY20
* Diminishing competitive advantage in ADAS (Advanced Driver Assistance Systems) as Level 2+ vehicles become ubiquitous

The report concludes that the average analyst price target of $263 indicates upside potential of only 2%, with a Sell rating on TSLA stock.
