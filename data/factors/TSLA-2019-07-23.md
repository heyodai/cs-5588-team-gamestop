Based on the news articles provided, here are the top 5 factors that may affect the stock price of TSLA:

1. **Tesla's quarterly loss**: Tesla is expected to report another quarterly loss, which could pressure its stock price. The company has been struggling with high-margin model sales and low profit margins.

2. **Diminishing sales of Model S and X**: The older models are no longer generating the same demand as the newer Model 3, and their prices have increased significantly. This could lead to a decline in overall Tesla sales and profitability.

3. **No significant redesigns for Model S and X**: Tesla's lack of major updates for its older models may be contributing to their declining sales. If the company fails to address this issue, it could further erode demand for these vehicles.

4. **Higher price gap between Model 3 and other models**: The increasing price difference between the Model 3 and Tesla's more expensive electric cars (Model S and X) could make it harder for the company to sell more of the lower-priced Model 3.

5. **Volume-driven growth**: While the Model 3 is selling well, its lower profit margins compared to the older models could be a concern. If Tesla relies too heavily on volume-driven growth, it may struggle to maintain profitability in the long term.
