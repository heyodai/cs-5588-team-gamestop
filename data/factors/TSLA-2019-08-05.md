According to the article, there are concerns among battery producers and electric automakers, including Tesla, about the long-term supply of nickel, a key material in their supply chain. The demand for nickel from lithium-ion batteries is forecast to surge 16 times by 2030, and batteries will account for more than half of demand for class-one nickel by then.

Tesla's global supply manager of battery metals, Sarah Maryssael, has expressed concerns about the lack of sufficient investment in new mines for materials like nickel, which could lead to higher prices as battery sector demand builds.

Nickel producer Independence Group NL's CEO, Peter Bradford, has stated that Tesla recognizes the biggest risk from a strategic supply point of view is nickel and is preparing for the new factory in China. He also noted that the dramatic price rise in 2019 will pale into insignificance compared to the future prices, which are expected to be higher.

The article also mentions that several companies, including Japan's Sumitomo Metal Mining Co., First Quantum Minerals Ltd., and Western Areas Ltd., are experiencing increased interest from potential nickel and cobalt customers in the EV sector.

Overall, the article suggests that the industry is facing a significant challenge in meeting the growing demand for nickel, which could lead to higher prices and reduced supply.
