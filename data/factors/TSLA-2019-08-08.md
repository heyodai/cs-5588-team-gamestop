Based on the text, here are some key points about Tesla and its safety claims:

* Tesla has been accused of making "misleading statements" over safety ratings of the Model 3 by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA).
* The NHTSA sent a cease-and-desist letter to Tesla on October 17, stating that Tesla's actions could confuse consumers and give it an unfair market advantage.
* Tesla has claimed that the Model 3 is "the safest car ever built" with the lowest probability of injury of all vehicles tested by the NHTSA.
* The NHTSA referred the issue to the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) to investigate any potential wrongdoing.

It appears that Tesla's safety claims are being scrutinized, and the company is facing criticism for making statements that may be misleading or confusing to consumers. However, it's worth noting that Tesla has not been found guilty of any wrongdoing, and the situation is still unfolding.

As an investor, it's essential to keep an eye on this development and consider how it may impact Tesla's stock price and reputation in the market.
