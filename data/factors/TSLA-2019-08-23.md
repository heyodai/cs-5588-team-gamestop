The article reports that Tesla's solar unit is facing a new challenge with Walmart suing the company over defective solar panel installations. The lawsuit, filed in New York state court, alleges that Tesla failed to abide by prudent industry practices in installing, operating, and maintaining its solar systems. The complaint claims that many of the panels had defects that could be seen by the naked eye or were easily identifiable with proper equipment.

The issue has prompted Walmart to disconnect all of its solar systems, which has resulted in a significant financial hit for Tesla. According to the lawsuit, the power not generated from the solar systems has contributed to at least $13.7 million in damages (not including lost incentives), a figure that increases by at least $37,400 daily.

This is not the first time Tesla's solar unit has faced controversy. In 2018, a class-action lawsuit was filed against Tesla over its solar panel installations, alleging that the company had engaged in deceptive and misleading marketing practices. The lawsuit claimed that Tesla had misrepresented the performance and durability of its solar panels, leading to widespread refunds and returns.

The dispute with Walmart is also notable because it comes at a time when Tesla's solar unit is trying to revive its business after a series of setbacks. In July, CEO Elon Musk announced a "relaunch" of the solar unit, which includes new leasing options and streamlined production processes. However, the company has struggled to regain market share in the competitive solar panel industry.

The suit against Walmart could potentially spook customers who are looking at Tesla's solar offerings, according to analyst Hugh Bromley. "This is the culmination of inattention being paid to the business," said Bromley. "Tesla needs to get its house in order if it wants to regain market share."

In a joint statement, Tesla and Walmart said they are in discussions to address the issue. Each company plans to provide an update on the litigation.

The article also notes that this is not the first time Tesla has faced regulatory scrutiny over its solar panel installations. In 2019, the California Public Utilities Commission fined Tesla $1 million for violating state regulations related to rooftop solar panel installations.

Overall, the dispute with Walmart highlights the ongoing challenges facing Tesla's solar unit as it tries to revamp its business and regain market share in a highly competitive industry.
