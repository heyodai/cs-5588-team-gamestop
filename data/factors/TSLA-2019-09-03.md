Here are some of the key points from the article:

* China Evergrande Group is the country's most indebted property firm, with $113.7 billion in debt and a core profit that fell 45% in the first half of the year.
* The company is diversifying into electric vehicles, with plans to become the world's biggest maker in the next three to five years.
* Despite its financial struggles, Evergrande is "too big to fail" due to its size and influence in the Chinese real estate market.
* The company has a large land reserve of 276 million square meters (905 million square feet) and dominates redevelopment projects in big cities such as Shenzhen.
* Land is scarce in Shenzhen, making urban renewal a key strategy for the city's growth, and Evergrande's access to cheap lots helps keep its land costs low.
* The company's diversification into electric cars is likely to bleed money for years, but securing low-cost inputs from local governments could help it stay afloat.
* Evergrande's billionaire founder, Hui Ka Yan, is the country's third-richest man, and the company's influence in Beijing's favor helps it secure favorable terms.
* The article concludes that while Evergrande's wild spending may seem folly to investors, the company's size and influence make it too big for the government to fail.

Overall, the article suggests that despite its financial struggles, Evergrande is a significant player in the Chinese real estate market and its failure could have broader implications for the economy.
