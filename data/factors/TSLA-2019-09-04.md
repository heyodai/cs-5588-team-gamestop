Based on the article, Nio stock is considered a hard pass due to several reasons:

1. High valuation: Despite massive declines in the stock price, shares remain overvalued with an enterprise value/sales (EV/Sales) ratio of 3.91.
2. Negative gross margins: The company's trailing 12-month operating losses are $1.6 billion, and negative gross margins may have accelerated further due to the sales collapse in July.
3. Cash hemorrhaging: Nio hemorrhages cash, which makes it hard for the company to survive without additional capital infusions.
4. Lack of competitive edge: The company lacks any sort of competitive edge, making it vulnerable to the economic fallout from the trade war with China.
5. High risk of bankruptcy: With high levels of debt and a shrinking cash position, bankruptcy risk remains high.

The article concludes that Nio stock faces multiple risks, including the U.S.-China trade war, which could further reduce Chinese demand for electric vehicles. The author advises investors to avoid Nio stock and instead look for better high-risk growth opportunities elsewhere.
