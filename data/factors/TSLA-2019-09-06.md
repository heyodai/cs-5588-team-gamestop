The article discusses the current state of Nio (NIO) stock, which is struggling to gain traction compared to its U.S.-based counterpart Tesla (TSLA). Despite being compared to Tesla as the "Tesla of China," Nio's sales figures and market share fail to back up this claim. In fact, Nio sells only 837 cars in July, a far cry from Tesla's 95,200 vehicles sold in the second quarter.

The article highlights several concerns about Nio's prospects, including:

1. Mounting losses: Nio is projected to lose money for years to come, with analysts forecasting $1.23 per share in losses in fiscal 2019 and 79 cents per share in fiscal 2020.
2. Lack of sales: Nio's sales are significantly lower than Tesla's, making it difficult to take the company seriously as a major player in the Chinese EV market.
3. Slow pace of earnings release: Nio has not announced its sales figures for August, which is unusual and raises concerns about the company's financial health.
4. Competition: Nio faces intense competition from other electric car companies operating in China, making it hard to stand out.

The article concludes that Nio needs to significantly increase its car sales to become a major player in the Chinese EV market. However, given the current state of the industry and the company's struggles, it is unlikely that Nio will achieve this in the near future. The author notes that Nio's stock price is currently trading near $2.70 per share, which may be too cheap considering the company's financial struggles.

Overall, the article presents a negative view of Nio's prospects and advises against buying the stock on hopes of a potential buyout or significant increase in sales.
