The article discusses the current state of Aurora Cannabis stock (ACB) and how it is performing in the cannabis market. The author suggests that investors are punishing Aurora for not delivering on projections, which is a common phenomenon in a bubble. However, the author also notes that Aurora has balance sheet issues and a high price-to-sales ratio, which may make investors cautious.

The article highlights several factors that are affecting the performance of Aurora Cannabis stock:

1. Regulatory approval: Health Canada's approval process for cannabis companies took longer than expected, leading to oversupply in the market.
2. CannTrust scandal: News broke about CannTrust growing marijuana in unlicensed rooms, which sent shockwaves through the market and caused investors to panic.
3. Acquisition strategy: Aurora has been aggressively acquiring other cannabis companies, which has led to dilution of shares and higher volatility.
4. Regulatory delays: The US market is still stalled due to regulatory issues, which means investors won't be able to assess Aurora's performance using conventional valuation metrics until after the 2020 first-quarter earnings.

The author concludes that while Aurora Cannabis stock may have further to fall in the short term, they are bullish on the long-term potential of the company and its industry. They suggest that investors should be cautious but not write off the stock entirely.
