The article discusses Nio, Inc. (NASDAQ:NIO), a Chinese electric vehicle manufacturer that is often compared to Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA). The author of the article argues that Nio's approach to the electric vehicle market is not well-suited for long-term success.

Here are some key points from the article:

1. **Nio's high-performance strategy**: Nio has focused on creating a high-performance category of electrics, which may not be the most practical or sustainable approach in the market.
2. **Competition with Tesla**: Nio is trying to compete directly with Tesla, which has established a strong brand and distribution network. This could make it difficult for Nio to gain traction.
3. **Lack of MEB support**: Nio is not using the MEB (Modular Electric Drive Toolkit) platform, which is a standard platform being adopted by Volkswagen (OTCMKTS:VLKAY) and Ford Motor (NYSE:F) in the US. This may limit Nio's access to economies of scale.
4. **Cash burn concerns**: Nio has been burning through cash at a rapid rate, which could lead to financial difficulties if not addressed.
5. **BYD as the winner**: The article suggests that BYD (OTCMKTS:BYDDF), another Chinese electric vehicle manufacturer, may be the biggest winner in China's electric vehicle market due to its focus on battery technology and efficient production standards.

Overall, the article presents a negative view of Nio's prospects, citing concerns about its high-performance strategy, competition with Tesla, lack of MEB support, cash burn issues, and BYD's potential as the winner.
