The article discusses the challenges faced by electric vehicle (EV) manufacturers, particularly in terms of affordability and demand. The European Automobile Manufacturers Association's president, Carlos Tavares, notes that the next big thing is not about EVs themselves, but about affordable mobility and how to make it work for the biggest number of people.

The article highlights several key points:

1. **Declining demand**: Sales of battery models have cratered in countries with significant subsidies, such as China, which saw a 16% decline in August.
2. **Poor margins**: Most EVs have poor profitability due to high production costs, making it difficult for carmakers to justify investment in new models.
3. **Charging infrastructure**: While charging infrastructure is improving, patchy coverage remains a significant challenge, particularly for long-distance travel.
4. **Industry lobbying**: Carmakers are lobbying governments to increase incentives and subsidies to support the adoption of EVs.

The article also mentions several initiatives by carmakers to boost their EV offerings, including:

1. **VW's ID.3**: A budget-friendly EV with a basic range of 330 kilometers (205 miles).
2. **Porsche Taycan Turbo S**: A high-end EV with a price point of $185,000.
3. **Mercedes-Benz's electric lineup**: The carmaker is adding at least 10 purely battery-powered cars through 2022.

The article concludes that the industry will face "lean years" until battery prices come down and profitability improves, but with continued government support and investment in charging infrastructure, EVs are poised to become a mainstream option.
