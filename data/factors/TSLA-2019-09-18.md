To answer the question, Nio stock is not expected to rise significantly without some positive developments in the future.

Nio's stock price responded positively to its recent announcements, including a private placement with an affiliate of Tencent worth $200 million. This investment will provide Nio with the resources it needs to mass-produce its ES6 and ES8 models, which have received positive reviews for their interior, technology, and speed.

Additionally, Nio's decision to cut 1,200 staff may help align demand with costs and supply, reducing the company's financial burden. This move will allow Nio to focus on maintaining its core operations, including research and development, while cutting costs in other areas.

However, it's essential for investors to be aware of the challenges facing Nio. The company is still a young and relatively small player in the electric vehicle (EV) market, which can make it difficult to predict its future performance. Moreover, the ongoing trade tensions between the US and China may have an impact on Nio's sales and revenue.

Investors who are considering investing in Nio stock should be aware that the company is highly speculative and carries significant risks. It's essential to conduct thorough research and due diligence before making any investment decisions.

In conclusion, while Nio's recent announcements have provided some positive momentum for its stock price, investors should approach this investment with caution and consider the challenges facing the company in the future.
