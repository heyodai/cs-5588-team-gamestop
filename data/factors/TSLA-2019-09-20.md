The article discusses the concept of Universal Basic Income (UBI), a proposal where every American would receive $1,000 per month in cash, funded by new rounds of central bank purchases of government bonds. The idea has been around for centuries and has gained renewed interest as a potential solution to address rising criticism of Quantitative Easing (QE) and its impact on the wealth gap.

The article highlights that:

* UBI was first suggested by Sir Thomas More in his 16th century work "Utopia" and later championed by free-market economists such as Friedrich Hayek and Milton Friedman.
* Trials in Finland, Canada, and India have shown limited success in achieving economic or social objectives, but some studies have found psychological benefits among recipients.
* Critics point to the financial constraints of funding UBI, with estimates suggesting that it would require a significant increase in income tax to fund, approximately 30%.
* The proposal has gained renewed interest as a way to neutralize criticism of QE and its impact on the wealthy, by providing a more palatable alternative.

However, the article also notes that:

* There is little new in central banks financing governments via QE or fiscal stimulus, including welfare spending.
* A universal basic income financed by helicopter money may perversely increase uncertainty among ordinary people.
* The proposal has been met with skepticism, with some countries' experiments showing limited effectiveness.

Overall, the article suggests that while UBI may be a tempting solution to economic problems, it is essential to consider its limitations and potential unintended consequences.
