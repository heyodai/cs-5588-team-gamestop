Blue Bird's shares traded at 2,580 rupiah (18 cents) in Jakarta on Monday, after reaching an all-time high of 12,500 rupiah in January 2015. The company plans to add 2,000 electric vehicles from Tesla and Chinese maker BYD to its fleet of cabs, with the goal of improving operational efficiency and generating revenue. 

Blue Bird's rival, Gojek, is valued at $14 billion and planning to raise over $4.5 billion in its latest funding round. The company's low fares have caused a major churn for taxi companies like Blue Bird, which need to look at new business models, even partnerships with ride-hailing players, to stay relevant.

Purnomo started working at Blue Bird in the mid-1990s and has already added about two dozen electric vehicles to its fleet. The company's assets-light model allows it to take the risk of financing EVs, while its rivals cannot replicate this model easily.

Blue Bird will also invest in the internet of things (IoT) technology, which links machines and gadgets and can help improve operational efficiency and implement dynamic pricing. The company now has the technical capability to fight back and the financial resources to challenge its rivals, without elaborating on how it plans to raise capital.
