The article discusses a $4 billion joint venture between Hyundai Motor Group and Aptiv Plc to develop autonomous cars. While the deal may seem promising, it's actually a cautious move by both companies.

Hyundai is contributing $1.6 billion in cash and $400 million in services, R&D, and intellectual property for its 50% share. Aptiv will hand over intellectual property and 700 employees, and the two promise to have an autonomous-driving platform by 2022. However, this deadline is likely a placeholder for further testing and refinement before fully self-driving cars become widespread.

The article notes that self-driving cars are still a marginal part of Aptiv's existing business, which focuses on more mundane technologies like cable harnesses and sensors. The 700 employees being transferred to the new autonomous unit don't seem impressive compared to Aptiv's total workforce of 143,000.

The author also mentions that the prospects for self-driving cars look bleak, with even conservative companies like Ford Motor Co. pushing back their targets to 2021. However, Hyundai and Aptiv are taking a more measured approach by investing $50 billion or so in software and hardware platforms over the next five years.

The article concludes that while there's still hype surrounding driverless cars, engineers and designers can now focus on making vehicles truly autonomous. The investment is a relatively modest option for becoming market leaders in this category.

Key points:

* Hyundai Motor Group and Aptiv Plc are investing $4 billion in a joint venture to develop autonomous cars.
