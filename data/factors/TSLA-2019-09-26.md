Based on the news articles, here are the top 5 factors that may affect the stock price of TSLA:

1. **Record Q3 deliveries**: Tesla's CEO Elon Musk said in an email to employees that the company has a "shot" at delivering 100,000 vehicles in the third quarter, which could be a record-breaking figure. This news has caused shares to jump 6.1% and may continue to drive the stock price higher if deliveries meet or exceed expectations.
2. **New software update**: Tesla is launching its latest over-the-air software update, which includes features such as streaming media support, Tesla Theater, and Smart Summon. The updated software could provide a boost to the company's services segment and attract new customers, potentially driving up demand for shares.
3. **Overseas expansion**: Tesla began delivering the Model 3 to new markets in Australia, which could help offset the headwind caused by the shrinking federal tax credit in the US. This expansion may lead to increased revenue and growth for the company, benefiting shareholders.
4. **Logistical challenges**: Musk mentioned in his email that the challenge is making sure that cars are delivered to customers on time. If Tesla can overcome these logistical challenges, it could lead to higher demand for shares as customers become more confident in the company's ability to deliver vehicles.
5. **Comparison to rival automakers**: General Motors Co. sold about 110,000 Chevrolet Silverado pickups in the second quarter just in the US, which is a significant comparison to Tesla's deliveries. If Tesla can beat this figure or demonstrate its growth potential, it may lead to increased investor confidence and drive up the stock price.

Note that these factors are subject to change and may interact with each other in complex ways. It's essential to conduct thorough analysis and consider multiple perspectives before making investment decisions.
