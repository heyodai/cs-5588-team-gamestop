The article discusses the challenges facing the United Auto Workers (UAW) union as the automotive industry transitions to electric vehicles (EVs). With many parts and components no longer needed in EVs, the supply chain is expected to shrink, leading to job losses. The UAW is concerned that German mega-supplier ZF Friedrichshafen AG may take work away from Chrysler's machining facility near Toledo and transmission complex in Kokomo, Indiana.

The article highlights several issues facing the UAW:

1. Shifting value chain: As automakers shift spending to electric propulsion, the market for parts used in internal combustion vehicles is expected to shrink by 6-20% by 2025.
2. Job losses: Engines and transmissions currently account for just under half of automaker manufacturing capacity, but this capacity may be reduced as EVs become more prevalent.
3. Low-wage workers: Suppliers like LG Chem Ltd., which assembles battery packs at a non-union plant in western Michigan, pay technicians starting wages around $16 an hour, which is below what UAW legacy employees earn.
4. Organizing foreign factories: The UAW will need to organize battery plants overseas, but labor experts believe it will have a tough time.

The article also notes that:

1. Batteries are mostly manufactured overseas and are relatively expensive, making them a significant challenge for automakers.
2. Suppliers like SK Innovation Co. Ltd. are capable of delivering high-quality products at competitive costs, making it difficult for carmakers to replicate their success.

Overall, the UAW faces significant challenges as the automotive industry transitions to EVs, including job losses, low-wage workers, and difficulties in organizing foreign factories.
