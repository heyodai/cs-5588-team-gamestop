Based on the news articles provided, here are the top 5 factors that may affect the stock price of TSLA:

1. **Missing Quarterly Delivery Target**: Tesla is likely to miss its own delivery target this quarter, which could lead to a decline in investor confidence and negatively impact the stock price.

2. **Labor Law Violations**: A California judge ruled that Elon Musk's tweets constituted threatening employees, which may lead to further scrutiny of the company's labor practices and potentially affect the stock price.

3. **Revenue Growth Concerns**: Analysts predict Tesla may post lower revenue for the third quarter than a year ago, which could be a downer for investors and negatively impact the stock price.

4. **Competition from Chinese Companies**: The Trump administration's denial of plans to delist Chinese companies from US exchanges may not provide the relief it promised, potentially leading to increased competition and downward pressure on Tesla's stock price.
