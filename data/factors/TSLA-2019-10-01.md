Here are the top 5 factors that may affect the stock price of TSLA:

1. **Profitability concerns**: Despite strong deliveries, Tesla's profitability is a concern, which may have led to its weak performance this year. If the company's profitability issues continue, it could negatively impact its stock price.

2. **Valuation concerns for Waymo**: Morgan Stanley cut its valuation of Alphabet's (GOOGL) Waymo self-driving car unit by $70 billion, which may have a ripple effect on Tesla's stock price as it is also investing in autonomous driving technology through DeepScale acquisition.

3. **Competition from NIO**: The article mentions that NIO was once dubbed China's "Tesla killer" but has struggled due to lower pricing, which could lead to increased competition for Tesla in the Chinese market and potentially affect its stock price.

4. **Government regulations on EVs**: Norway plans to roll back some of the tax incentives for electric vehicles, which may impact demand for Tesla's cars in the country. Additionally, government regulations on fossil fuel vehicles may also impact the overall EV market, affecting Tesla's sales and stock price.

5. **Software update issues with Smart Summon**: The article mentions that Tesla's software update for Smart Summon has caused some inconvenience, which could lead to a negative perception of the company's ability to deliver its products and services, potentially affecting its stock price.
