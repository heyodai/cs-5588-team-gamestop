The article discusses how the search for high returns has led to the growth of direct lending in middle-market loans, which is affecting not just aggressive buyout firms and direct lenders but also average investors. The article highlights several examples of companies that have invested heavily in this market, including business development companies (BDCs) like Ares Capital Corp. and Owl Rock's BDC, as well as pension funds like the Canada Pension Plan Investment Board.

The article notes that while these firms may benefit from high returns on their investments, they also pose a risk to other investors who may not fully understand the market or have access to the same level of expertise. The growth of middle-market CLOs (collateralized loan obligations) has led to a proliferation of new investment products that can be complex and opaque, making it difficult for even sophisticated investors to navigate.

The article also suggests that the cycle of high returns on direct lending could lead to a repeat of the 2008 financial crisis, where excessive borrowing and risk-taking ultimately caused many companies to fail. The article notes that middle-market CLOs are now worth $57 billion, which is almost triple the level of six years ago, and that they often offer higher yields than traditional bonds.

Overall, the article concludes that while direct lending in middle-market loans may seem like a simple solution to generate high returns, it poses significant risks for many investors, including average investors who may not have the expertise or resources to navigate this complex market.
