Based on the news articles provided, here are the top 5 factors that may affect the stock price of TSLA (Tesla):

1. **Potential Recession**: A recession could significantly impact Tesla's stock price, as a slowdown in economic growth would likely lead to reduced demand for electric vehicles. NYU professor of business stated that Tesla "may lose more than 80 percent" of its value if a recession occurs.

2. **Missing Sales Expectations**: Tesla's recent sales miss, where it delivered 97,000 vehicles in the third quarter (vs. analyst expectations of 99,000), led to a decline in its stock price. This suggests that investors are becoming increasingly cautious about the company's ability to meet sales targets.

3. **Competition from Other EV Makers**: The emergence of new electric vehicle (EV) players, such as Polestar 2 and ID.3, could potentially disrupt Tesla's market share and lead to a decline in its stock price. Analysts are concerned that Tesla may struggle to maintain its dominance in the EV space.

4. **Regulatory Uncertainty**: While not explicitly mentioned in the news articles, regulatory uncertainty, particularly around EV taxes and incentives, could also impact Tesla's stock price. Changes in regulations or policies could affect consumer demand for electric vehicles.

5. **Increasing Competition from ICE Makers**: The rise of electric motorcycles, such as Harley-Davidson's new bike, could signal a shift towards more sustainable mobility options, potentially increasing competition for traditional internal combustion engine (ICE) makers like Ford and General Motors. This increased competition could lead to downward pressure on Tesla's stock price.

These factors highlight the challenges facing Tesla in maintaining its market position and profitability, particularly in an increasingly competitive EV space.
