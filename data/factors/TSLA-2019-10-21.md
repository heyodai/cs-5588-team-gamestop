Based on the news provided, here are the top 5 factors that may affect the stock price of TSLA (Tesla):

1. **Record vehicle deliveries**: Tesla has delivered a record number of cars for two consecutive quarters and is expected to continue this trend in the fourth quarter. This positive momentum could boost investor confidence and drive up the stock price.

2. **Brexit battles and earnings season**: The ongoing Brexit negotiations and earnings season may impact investor sentiment, leading to market volatility that could affect Tesla's stock price.

3. **Competition from General Motors (GM) and Ford**: GM is ramping up its electric vehicle (EV) production with premium trucks and SUVs, which may compete directly with Tesla's offerings. This increased competition could put pressure on Tesla's stock price.

4. **Valuation concerns**: Some analysts and investors have expressed concerns about Tesla's valuation, citing the company's high price-to-earnings ratio and the challenges of scaling up production while maintaining profitability. If these concerns persist, it could lead to a decline in Tesla's stock price.

5. **Government subsidies and tax credits**: The US government's Phase 1 trade deal with China includes provisions that could impact Tesla's sales of its electric vehicles in China. Additionally, the phase-out of government subsidies for EVs in Europe may also affect Tesla's production levels and revenue. Any changes to these policies or a reduction in available incentives could negatively impact Tesla's stock price.

These factors highlight the competitive and regulatory landscape surrounding the EV industry, which can have a significant impact on the stock prices of companies like Tesla.
