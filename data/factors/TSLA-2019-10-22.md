The article discusses the performance of "glamour stocks" and "boring stocks" in the US market. Glamour stocks are shares of the most expensive and least profitable companies, while boring stocks are shares of the cheapest and most profitable companies. The article highlights that glamour stocks have outpaced boring stocks by 16.8 percentage points a year over the last six years through August, including dividends.

However, the article also notes that this is not a sustainable trend and that investors should be cautious. Glamour stocks have a high price-to-book ratio of 10.1 compared to boring stocks' ratio of 0.8. This means that glamour stocks are trading at a significantly higher valuation than boring stocks.

The article mentions several examples of glamorous companies, including Uber Technologies Inc., Lyft Inc., and WeWork, which have seen their stock prices decline significantly since their public market debuts. The author also notes that some investors who have held onto these stocks for too long may be in for an unpleasant surprise.

In addition, the article cites data from Dartmouth professor Ken French, who has compiled numbers showing that glamour stocks have beaten boring stocks just 25% of the time over rolling six-year periods since July 1963. The author notes that this is not a guarantee of future success and that investors should be aware of the risks involved.

Overall, the article advises readers to exercise caution when investing in glamour stocks and to consider the potential risks and downsides before making any investment decisions.
