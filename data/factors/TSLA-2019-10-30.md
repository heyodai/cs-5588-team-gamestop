Tesla CEO Elon Musk delivered a series of positive updates during his recent earnings report, including:

1. The company's new factory in China is on track and the Model Y crossover SUV will launch earlier than expected.
2. Tesla deployed 43 megawatts of solar in the third quarter, a 48% jump from the previous three months.
3. The company delivered a record 97,000 vehicles in the third quarter.

Musk also acknowledged that he probably wouldn't support the SolarCity acquisition again given the stress Tesla faced from the Model 3 push. He stated that he would have let SolarCity execute by itself and that the company's internal stress was a big distraction.

Additionally, Musk had a confrontational exchange with Randy Baron, a California-based lawyer for Tesla shareholders challenging the wisdom of the SolarCity acquisition. Musk called Baron "reprehensible" and accused him of being a "very bad person."

The case is set for trial in March 2020 before Delaware Chancery Judge Joseph Slights III.
