The article discusses the potential comeback of Uber (UBER) stock after a dark period, with analysts predicting that the company will become profitable in 2021. Wedbush Securities has an "outperform" rating on Uber stock with a 12-month price target of $45, which is 67% above the current stock price. The article highlights several reasons why Wedbush is bullish on Uber:

1. **100 million+ consumers on the platform**: Uber expects to have 100 million users on its platform, which will translate into improved growth and profitability.
2. **Unparalleled global monetization engine**: Despite being less than 3% penetrated today, Uber's global monetization engine has tremendous potential for growth.
3. **Higher margins**: The adjusted EBITDA of Rides, Uber's core business, was positive $631 million in Q3, with a range of profitability in its most profitable markets ranging from 17% to 62%.
4. **Increased runway for growth**: With the lockup overhang removed, Wedbush expects Uber stock price to rebound and climb.

However, the article also notes that investing in Uber involves taking on above-average risk, as evidenced by the company's history of losing money. The author is not a fan of investing in money-losing companies and recommends exercising caution.

The second part of the article shifts focus to Tesla (TSLA), highlighting its first-mover advantage over rival car makers. The author notes that Nokia missed an opportunity to develop smartphones after introducing the iPhone 3G, while Apple seized the moment and became the largest smartphone maker. Similarly, Tesla has taken a leadership role in the electric vehicle market and is poised for continued growth.

The article concludes by emphasizing the importance of recognizing and capitalizing on first-mover advantages in various industries.
