Here are the top 5 factors that may affect the stock price of TSLA (Tesla):

1. **Construction of new European factory in Berlin**: Tesla's announcement to build its first European factory and design center near Berlin, with plans to start production in 2021, is a significant development that may impact the company's stock price. The move could be seen as a positive step towards increasing the company's presence in Europe and reducing dependence on China for battery production.

2. **Growing investor confidence**: The recent surge in Tesla's stock price, with shares rising over 40% since October, suggests growing investor confidence in the company's ability to deliver profits and grow its business. This positive sentiment may continue if Tesla continues to surprise investors with its earnings reports.

3. **Battery production and manufacturing capacity expansion**: Tesla's announcement to build batteries, powertrains, and vehicles at the Berlin factory, including the lower-priced Model Y sports utility vehicle, suggests a significant investment in battery production and manufacturing capacity. This could lead to increased efficiency and reduced costs, which may positively impact the company's stock price.

4. **Competition from other EV manufacturers**: The increasing competition from other electric vehicle (EV) manufacturers, such as Rivian, Lucid Motors, and NIO, may put pressure on Tesla's market share and profitability. If Tesla fails to maintain its lead in the EV market, its stock price may suffer.

5. **Regulatory changes and policy uncertainty**: Changes in government regulations and policies, particularly those related to electric vehicles and renewable energy, can impact Tesla's business operations and profitability. For example, changes in tax incentives or trade policies could affect demand for Tesla's products or increase costs associated with production.

Note that these are just potential factors that may affect the stock price of TSLA, and actual outcomes may vary based on various market and economic conditions.
