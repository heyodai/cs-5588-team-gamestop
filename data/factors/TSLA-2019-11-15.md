The article discusses the pros and cons of buying Plug Power stock as a potential investment opportunity in the emerging hydrogen fuel cell market. Here are the main points:

Pros:

1. **Government support**: The US government has set ambitious targets for hydrogen fuel cell vehicles, which could lead to increased demand and growth for companies like Plug Power.
2. **Big supporters**: Toyota and Honda, two major automakers, have backed hydrogen fuel cells as a viable alternative energy source, which could help drive adoption and increase sales ofPlug Power's products.
3. **Investment in infrastructure**: California has plans to develop 200 hydrogen refueling stations by 2025, which could increase the visibility and availability of Plug Power's products.

Cons:

1. **High costs**: Hydrogen refueling is currently more expensive than gasoline, with prices ranging from $16/kg in California, making it less competitive with traditional fossil fuels.
2. **Limited infrastructure**: There are only 39 hydrogen refueling stations in California, with another 25 due to appear soon, which may not be enough to meet growing demand for Plug Power's products.
3. **High cost of cars**: Hydrogen-powered cars are currently expensive, with prices starting at around $59,345, making them less accessible to the average consumer.

Overall, while there are some positive factors that could support Plug Power stock, such as government support and big supporters, the high costs and limited infrastructure in California may be a significant challenge for the company.
