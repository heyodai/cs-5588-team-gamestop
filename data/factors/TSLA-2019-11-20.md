Based on the provided news articles, here are the top 5 factors that may affect the stock price of TSLA (Tesla):

1. **Production Costs**: The ability to produce the Cybertruck at competitive costs will be crucial in determining its success and profitability. Analysts like Daniel Ives from Wedbush have highlighted the importance of production costs, suggesting that Tesla needs to demonstrate how it plans to keep costs down for the new model.

2. **Safety Concerns**: Recent reports of drivers falling asleep behind the wheel while using Autopilot have raised concerns about the safety of Tesla's technology. If the company fails to address these issues, it could impact investor confidence and lead to a decline in stock price.

3. **Trade Tensions and Global Market Conditions**: The ongoing trade tensions between China and the US, as well as the global economic slowdown, may affect Tesla's sales and profitability. India's plan to offer incentives to foreign manufacturers, including Tesla, may also have an impact on the company's stock price if it is seen as a positive sign for the industry.

4. **Brexit-Related Supply Chain Disruptions**: Tesla's decision to build its first major European factory in Germany highlights the potential risks of Brexit-related supply chain disruptions. If the UK's exit from the EU causes significant delays or increases costs, it could negatively impact Tesla's operations and stock price.

5. **Competition in the Electric Vehicle Market**: The electric vehicle market is becoming increasingly competitive, with other companies like Rivian, Lucid Motors, and Hyundai/Kia investing heavily in new models. If Tesla fails to innovate or keep up with competitors, it may struggle to maintain its market share and stock price.
