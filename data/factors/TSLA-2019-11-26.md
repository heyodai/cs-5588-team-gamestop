The article discusses the current state of technology stocks and their performance in recent years, drawing parallels with the late 1990s when tech enthusiasts were chasing tech companies like Tesla, Netflix, and Google. The NYSE FANG+ Index has returned a blistering 23.2% a year from October 2014 through Friday, outpacing the S&P 500 Index by nearly the same margin as it did in November 1998.

The author notes that the fear of missing out (FOMO) on tech stocks is still prevalent among investors, with billionaire investor Stanley Druckenmiller experiencing a $3 billion loss when he scooped up internet stocks in 1999 despite already being invested in them. The article also mentions that the current FANG+ Index has a similar correlation with foreign stock markets and interest rates.

The author suggests that the similarities between the two periods are coincidental, but the outcome is not: both times, tech stocks outperformed other asset classes when investors failed to sell during the peak of the bubble. The article concludes that the end of the FANG era may not be imminent, as investors who managed to sidestep the fad in previous iterations may become the catalyst for keeping the party going.

Some key takeaways from the article include:

* The NYSE FANG+ Index has returned a 23.2% annualized return since October 2014.
* This is nearly the same margin as the Nasdaq 100 Index outpaced the S&P 500 Index in November 1998.
* Investors who declined to sell during previous tech bubbles experienced significant losses, such as billionaire investor Stanley Druckenmiller's $3 billion loss.
* The current correlation between FANG+ stocks and foreign stock markets and interest rates is similar to that of the late 1990s.

Overall, the article highlights the ongoing allure of technology stocks for investors and the potential risks associated with investing in these areas.
