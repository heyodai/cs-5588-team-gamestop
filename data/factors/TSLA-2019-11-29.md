There are no direct mentions of the factors affecting TSLA's stock price in the provided news articles. However, some indirect points can be made:

1. Cybertruck Pre-orders: Tesla's Cybertruck has garnered significant attention with over 250,000 pre-orders, which could positively impact the company's stock price due to increased demand and visibility.

2. Lawsuit Against Fiat Chrysler: General Motors filing a federal racketeering lawsuit against Fiat Chrysler might have a minimal impact on TSLA's stock price, as it is a separate entity from Tesla.

3. Retail Pressure and Holiday Sales: The news mentions that retailers are under financial pressure and lower holiday sales could exacerbate the situation. This information may indicate economic uncertainty or consumer spending trends, which could potentially affect the stock market in general, but has no direct connection to TSLA's specific performance.

4. Musk's Defamation Trial: While the defamation trial is a notable event involving Tesla's CEO Elon Musk, its potential impact on TSLA's stock price is uncertain and may depend on various factors such as the outcome of the trial, public perception, and overall market sentiment.
