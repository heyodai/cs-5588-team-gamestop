Based on the article, here are the top 5 factors that may affect the stock price of TSLA (Tesla):

1. **Increased competition in electric vehicles**: The article mentions that BRP is exploring an electric push and has unveiled prototypes, which could lead to increased competition in the electric vehicle market. This could potentially negatively impact Tesla's stock price.
2. **Hydrogen and fuel cell technology surge**: The rise of hydrogen and fuel cell technology could disrupt traditional battery-electric vehicles (BEVs) like Tesla's, making them less competitive in the market. This could also lead to increased competition from companies like BRP that are investing in these technologies.
3. **Changing consumer preferences towards sustainability**: The article highlights the growing demand for sustainable transportation options, particularly among millennials. If consumers increasingly prefer eco-friendly options, this could lead to a shift away from traditional gasoline-powered vehicles and towards electric or alternative fuel vehicles, potentially affecting Tesla's stock price.
4. **Global trade agreements and tariffs**: The article mentions that BRP has benefited from a new trade agreement between Canada, the US, and Mexico, which has helped boost its shares. Similar global trade agreements could have a positive impact on other companies in the industry, including Tesla.
5. **Investor interest in electric vehicles**: The article quotes BRP's CEO as saying that investors are showing interest in electric vehicles, particularly among Europe-based investors. If more investors become interested in electric vehicle technology, it could lead to increased demand and potentially boost Tesla's stock price.
