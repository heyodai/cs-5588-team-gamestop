The article discusses how various European countries are implementing incentives to encourage electric vehicle (EV) sales. Here are some key points:

1. **France**: Renault's Zoe model is the best-selling fully electric vehicle in France, with a 43% market share. The government offers up to 6,000 euros and a conversion bonus for buyers scrapping an old clunker for an EV.
2. **United Kingdom**: Despite Brexit uncertainty, UK sales of all-electric cars doubled through November to 32,911 units. The U.K. offers grants and rebates of up to 3,500 pounds for pure electric vehicles.
3. **Netherlands**: The government plans to give tax advantages for at least the next five years to reach its goal of only clean cars in the country by 2050. Local governments have also implemented their own measures, such as exemptions on road tax and sales-tax rate reductions.
4. **Norway and Sweden**: These countries offer generous incentives, including exemption from duties, free parking, toll exemptions, and allowed use of collective transport lanes. However, some Swedes cash in on the bonus and export their electric cars to Norway.
5. **Denmark**: The Social Democrat government canceled planned tax increases on electric cars and increased tax deductions for driving an electric car to work.
6. **Italy**: Italy lags behind other European markets, with less than 8,000 battery-electric vehicles sold in the first nine months of the year. The government has unveiled incentives, but they are not enough to bridge the price and cultural gap.

The article highlights the different approaches taken by each country, which have led to unintended consequences, such as some Swedes exporting their electric cars to Norway. Despite these challenges, many countries are committed to reaching their goals of increasing EV adoption and reducing carbon emissions.
