The article discusses the phase-out of solar tax credits in 2020, with some industries facing uncertainty about future tax breaks. Here are the key points:

1. **Biodiesel tax credit**: The biodiesel tax credit is set to expire, and producers warn that without renewal, more manufacturing plants could shut early next year.
2. **Tax extenders deal**: A broader tax extenders package that includes credits for alternative energy sources, such as wind power and energy storage, may be included in a government spending bill.
3. **White House opposition**: The White House is lobbying Republicans against renewing tax credits for alternative energy sources, making the negotiations politically contentious.
4. **Electric vehicle credit**: There is no clear indication that an expansion of the electric vehicle consumer tax credit will be included in the package.
5. **Government shutdown risk**: A final deal on the tax extenders package needs to be reached by Monday evening to avoid a government shutdown before federal funding lapses on Friday.

The article also mentions some companies' reactions to the uncertainty:

* Renewable Energy Group Inc. (REGI) stock rose 11.9% as of 12:48 p.m.
* Biodiesel producers were up in trading Monday, likely due to concerns about their industry's future tax status.
* General Motors Co. and Tesla Inc. have already reached the cap on consumer tax credits for electric-vehicle purchases, which are still available but limited.

Overall, the article highlights the uncertainty surrounding tax extenders for alternative energy sources and the potential impact on industries such as biodiesel production and electric vehicle manufacturing.
