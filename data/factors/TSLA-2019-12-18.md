The article discusses the recent trend of low yields and tight credit spreads in bond markets, which may signal a potential recession. However, it also highlights the importance of not chasing high-yield bonds as a sound investment strategy.

The author notes that the spread between junk bonds and investment-grade debt has almost evaporated, making double-B debt "junk" in the classical sense. The article suggests that investors should be cautious when considering upgrading to single-A or double-A credit quality, as it may not offer sufficient return relative to higher-yielding junk bonds.

Instead, the author proposes a more conservative approach by focusing on investment-grade debt until junk bonds actually pay something that better reflects their additional risk. This strategy prioritizes balance-sheet resilience over potentially high returns.

The article also touches on Tesla's plans to launch an electric vehicle manufacturing company in Shanghai and its potential impact on prices of China-built Model 3 sedans. The report suggests that Tesla may slash the price of these cars by at least 20% next year due to improved local sourcing and reduced costs.

Overall, the article provides a nuanced analysis of bond market trends and cautions investors against chasing high-yield bonds without considering their potential risks and implications for balance-sheet resilience.
