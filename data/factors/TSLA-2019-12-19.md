Based on the provided news articles, here are the top 5 factors that may affect the stock price of TSLA:

1. **Battery Safety Concerns**: The recent fatal crash involving a Tesla Model S in Florida highlights the risks associated with lithium-ion batteries in electric vehicles. If Tesla's battery technology is not reliable or safe, it could lead to increased regulatory scrutiny and damage to the company's reputation, potentially affecting its stock price.

2. **Increasing Competition from Fossil Fuels and Biodiesel**: The tax-benefit extensions passed by Congress favor fossil fuels and biodiesel over electric vehicles like Tesla. This shift in policy could make it more challenging for Tesla to compete with traditional energy sources, which may impact the company's sales and revenue growth.

3. **Regulatory Pressures**: As mentioned earlier, battery safety concerns are a pressing issue. Additionally, Tesla faces regulatory pressures related to its Autopilot features, which AAA warns can increase distracted driving. Stricter regulations or changes in government policies could negatively impact Tesla's stock price.

4. **Competition from General Motors and Ford**: The recent investments made by General Motors and Ford in the automotive industry may pose a threat to Tesla's market share. If these companies successfully develop their own electric vehicle offerings, they could gain an edge over Tesla, potentially affecting its stock price.

5. **Elon Musk's Leadership Style and Communication**: Elon Musk's reputation and leadership style can have a significant impact on Tesla's stock price. Any public controversy or criticism related to his management style or communication skills may lead to market volatility and affect the company's stock performance.

Note that these factors are not exhaustive, and other events, such as earnings reports, industry trends, and global economic conditions, can also influence the stock price of TSLA.
