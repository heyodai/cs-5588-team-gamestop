The article discusses the recent price target increase by Wedbush analyst Daniel Ives for Tesla Inc. (TSLA), which now stands at $370 from $270. Ives cites improving fundamentals, including strong demand for Model 3 and European strength, as reasons to believe Tesla's turnaround is credible. The analyst also mentions that the company's Shanghai facility is being built ahead of schedule and will drive growth in China. However, Ives maintains a neutral rating on the stock while taking a wait-and-see approach to the current demand/profitability spurt.

Key points from the article:

* Tesla shares have gained 28% in 2019, despite initial skepticism over Elon Musk's plans.
* Model 3 consumer demand and profitability are on an "upward trajectory for the fourth quarter."
* European strength should drive upside this quarter, enabling Tesla to comfortably hit its vehicle delivery guidance of 360K - 400K units for FY19.
* The Shanghai facility is ahead of schedule and will drive growth in China.
* If Tesla can sustain profitability and demand going forward, it could "open up a new chapter of growth and multiple expansion."
* Wedbush analyst Daniel Ives maintained his neutral rating on the stock while moving closer to believing in the turnaround.

Overall, the article suggests that Tesla's recent price target increase is driven by improving fundamentals, but also notes that skepticism remains and further validation is needed before a more bullish stance can be taken.
