Tesla has begun delivering its first vehicles made at its Shanghai factory, marking a significant milestone in the company's expansion into China's large and growing electric vehicle market.

Here are some key points from the article:

* Tesla has started delivering Model 3 sedans built at its Shanghai factory, just under a year since it began work on the $2 billion plant.
* The event marks a record for global automakers in China, with the factory starting to deliver cars to customers just 357 days after construction began.
* The first batch of cars is priced at 355,800 yuan ($50,000) before subsidies, and Tesla had said it wanted to start deliveries before the Lunar New Year beginning on January 25.
* This delivery marks a significant milestone for Tesla as it aims to bolster its presence in China's largest car market and minimize the impact of the U.S.-China trade war.

Overall, this is a positive development for Tesla, which has been expanding its operations in China in recent years. The company's ability to deliver cars on time and meet demand in one of the world's largest markets is seen as a major achievement, and it sets the stage for further growth and expansion in the region.
