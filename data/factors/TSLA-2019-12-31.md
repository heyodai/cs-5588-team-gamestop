Based on the article, it appears that Nio is facing several challenges that make its long-term prospects uncertain. Here are some of the key issues mentioned:

1. **Highly priced cars**: Nio's EVs are expensive, with the ES6 SUV starting at $52,000. This makes them unaffordable for most Chinese consumers, who have lower salaries and different priorities.
2. **Staff costs**: Nio has high staff costs, which are likely to be difficult to cut without sacrificing quality or competitiveness. The company spent 4.11 billion yuan on its workforce in 2019, which is more than three times the average white-collar salary in China's tier-one cities.
3. **Infrastructure challenges**: China's infrastructure is not yet geared up for mass EV adoption, with limited charging stations and congested roads. This makes it difficult for Nio to sell its cars to consumers who want convenient charging options.
4. **Parking challenges**: Even in big cities like Beijing, parking is a major challenge, making it hard for Nio's customers to find suitable spaces for their cars.

These issues suggest that Nio faces significant obstacles to success, including high costs, limited consumer demand, and inadequate infrastructure. While speculators may try to profit from the company's recent momentum, it is likely that these challenges will continue to weigh on its prospects in 2020 and beyond.
