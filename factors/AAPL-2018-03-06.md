Based on the provided text, here are two potential catalysts that could slow down iPhone revenue:

1. **Apple Music's impact on the music streaming industry**: One analyst thinks Apple should go the wrong way with music streaming by introducing a free tier for Apple Music. This could potentially disrupt the traditional music distribution model and affect Apple's revenue from music streaming.
2. **Fitbit's struggles in the wearables market**: Fitbit recently posted fourth-quarter numbers that missed estimates, leading to a share price plunge to an all-time low. This could be a concern for investors if it affects consumer demand for wearable devices, which is also a growing market for Apple.

These two factors could potentially slow down iPhone revenue by disrupting traditional music distribution and affecting the wearables market, both of which are areas where Apple has a strong presence.
