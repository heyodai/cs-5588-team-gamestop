Apple has announced that it will close a security gap that allowed outsiders to pry personal information from locked iPhones without a password. This change will thwart law enforcement agencies that have been exploiting this vulnerability to collect evidence in criminal investigations. The loophole will be shut down in a forthcoming update to Apple's iOS software, which powers iPhones. Once fixed, iPhones will no longer be vulnerable to intrusion via the Lightning port used both to transfer data and to charge iPhones.
