The article discusses the current state of the technology sector, particularly in relation to Apple's iPhone sales and Samsung's quarterly profits. Here are some key points:

1. **Apple's iPhone sales**: Despite global smartphone demand slowing down, Apple has maintained a strong performance with 216.76 million iPhones sold last year.
2. **Samsung's slow growth**: Samsung reported its slowest quarterly profit growth in a year, citing higher marketing costs and lower revenues due to the slowdown in the smartphone market.
3. **Pressure on Apple**: The slow growth of Samsung and other tech companies puts pressure on Apple to maintain its sales momentum, particularly with the launch of new iPhone models expected later this year.
4. **Analyst expectations**: Analysts expect Apple to report modest growth in iPhone sales for the June quarter, with total revenue likely to increase by a double-digit percentage due to higher average selling prices.
5. **Global market trends**: The article notes that global stocks drifted lower on Tuesday as tech sector weakness continued to hold down markets, and investors are watching earnings from Apple and other companies closely.

Overall, the article suggests that Apple is still performing well despite the challenges in the smartphone market, but the company will need to continue to deliver solid results to maintain its momentum.
