There is no single news article or topic that ties all these pieces together. However, I can try to provide some context and connections between them.

It seems that the articles are related to technology and business, with a focus on Apple Inc., Twitter, and other tech giants. There is also a mention of China's economy and Baidu, a Chinese search engine company.

Some common themes that emerge from these articles include:

1. The growing dominance of Apple Inc. in the global market, with its revenue continuing to accelerate.
2. Concerns about data privacy and security, particularly in relation to social media platforms like Twitter and messaging apps.
3. The rise of China's tech giants, including Alibaba and Baidu, which are expanding their presence globally.
4. Market trends and analysis, including discussions about the best-performing stocks in 2018 and potential opportunities for investors.

If you're looking for a summary or a way to tie these articles together, I can suggest some possible questions or topics:

* How is Apple Inc.'s dominance affecting other tech companies, particularly those in the social media space?
* What are the implications of Baidu's growth on China's global presence and economic influence?
* How do concerns about data privacy and security impact the broader tech industry and society as a whole?

Please let me know if you'd like me to explore any of these topics further or provide more context.
