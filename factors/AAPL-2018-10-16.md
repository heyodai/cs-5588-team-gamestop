Goldman Sachs recently put out a note saying that there are "multiple signs of rapidly slowing consumer demand in China" and that this "very weak consumer demand" could lead to weakness in the numbers over the next few quarters. If Goldman is right, it could impact Apple's ability to generate revenue and profit, leading to a potential drop in stock price.
