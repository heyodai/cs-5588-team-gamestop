Apple's iPhone sales were below analysts' expectations, which led to a decline in the company's stock price after hours. The company also announced that it would stop reporting unit sales of its iPhones, which could make it harder for investors to understand the main drivers of the company's growth. Despite this, Apple reported record revenue and profit for the quarter, with earnings per share (EPS) beating expectations and revenue above analysts' forecasts. However, the disappointing forecast for the holiday period led to a decline in the stock price.
