This investment is part of Apple's efforts to expand its operations in the United States, with plans to create 20,000 jobs across the country over the next five years.

The article also mentions that Apple has already added 6,000 jobs to its American workforce in 2018 and now employs 90,000 people in all 50 states. Additionally, the company has committed $10 billion for new data centers over the next five years.
