The article discusses the current state of Roku's stock and provides an analysis on whether it is a good time to buy or sell. The author suggests that Roku's fundamentals are favorable, as the company has turned into a dominant OTT video service aggregator and curator. They also mention that the EU's competition chief, Vestager, has stated that a decision on whether a UK tax scheme for multinationals breaches EU state aid rules is unlikely before end-March.

Some key points from the article include:

* Roku's stock has been retreating back to its 20-day moving average at $60, which may be a good entry point for investors.
* The author suggests that if Roku can hold this technical level for several trading days, it looks like the worst of this selloff is already over.
* However, if Roku's stock continues to fall and drops below $60, the next line of defense comes in at $50, which is where both the 50- and 200-day moving averages currently sit.
* The author believes that Roku's long-term fundamentals are healthy and supports a buy-the-dip approach for investors.

Overall, the article provides a neutral perspective on Roku's stock and suggests that it may be a good opportunity to invest in the company, but only if you believe in its long-term fundamentals.
