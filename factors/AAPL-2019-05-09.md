The article discusses the impact of the US-China trade war on companies that supply electronics to Apple, including Foxconn and Sharp. Here are some key points:

1. **Sharp's weak outlook**: Japan's Sharp Corp expects operating profit to rise 18.8% this year, but this is below its mid-term target.
2. **Foxconn's dependence on Apple**: The world's largest contract manufacturer, Foxconn, is trying to cut its dependence on iPhone maker Apple as smartphone sales plateau.
3. **Dialog Semiconductor's business with Apple**: Despite losing a power management contract, Dialog Semi has been awarded new business from Apple for the development and supply of other mixed-signal integrated circuits.
4. **Nvidia's stock performance**: Nvidia NVDA shares have climbed 30% so far this year as part of the broader market comeback driven by tech giants such as Apple AAPL and Facebook FB.

These articles suggest that the US-China trade war is having a negative impact on companies that supply electronics to Apple, particularly in Japan. However, some companies like Dialog Semiconductor are finding ways to adapt and continue to do business with Apple despite the challenges posed by the trade war.
