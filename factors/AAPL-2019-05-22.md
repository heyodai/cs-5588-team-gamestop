According to the article, China has surpassed the US as the world's largest smart speaker market. This is a significant shift in the industry, and it reflects growing demand for smart speakers in China.

The article mentions that Baidu (BIDU) and Alibaba (BABA), both Chinese technology companies, have benefited from this trend. The growth of smart speaker sales in China has provided new opportunities for these companies to expand their presence in the market.

In contrast, the US market, which was previously dominated by American tech heavyweights such as Amazon (AMZN) and Alphabet (GOOGL) subsidiary Google, is now experiencing a decline in sales. This could be due to various factors, including changes in consumer behavior, increased competition from Chinese vendors, or shifts in government policies.

Overall, the article suggests that China's smart speaker market is rapidly growing, while the US market is slowing down. This shift has significant implications for companies operating in the industry and highlights the evolving landscape of global technology markets.
