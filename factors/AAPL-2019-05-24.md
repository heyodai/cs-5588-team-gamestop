The article discusses the current state of Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. (BABA) stock and its performance in recent times. Here are the main points:

1. **Recent decline**: BABA stock has dropped over 10% since May 3rd, despite a strong earnings report from JD.com (NASDAQ:JD), a Chinese e-commerce rival.
2. **Fear of trade war**: The decline is attributed to fears about the impact of a trade war on the Chinese economy and Alibaba's dominance in e-commerce.
3. **Long-term problem**: Investors have had only one good year, 2017, when BABA stock price skyrocketed 96%. Since then, shares are below where they traded before the beginning of 2018.
4. **Risks associated with BABA**: The Chinese economy is still a concern, and Alibaba's accounting practices are opaque. The VIE structure means U.S. investors don't actually own shares of Alibaba.
5. **Buying opportunities**: Bulls argue that continual pressure on the share price could lead to repeated buying opportunities as investors seek value in BABA stock.

Overall, the article suggests that while BABA stock has been underperforming recently, it's essential for investors to consider the long-term risks and potential benefits associated with investing in Alibaba. The stock may offer buying opportunities as investors wait for a catalyst to drive price growth.
