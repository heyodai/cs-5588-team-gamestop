The article discusses the departure of Apple's chief design officer, Jony Ive, who is leaving the company after nearly 30 years. The news has sent shockwaves through the tech industry, and several key aspects of Apple's product design and development are likely to change as a result.

Here are some key points from the article:

* Ive was instrumental in designing many of Apple's most iconic products, including the original iMac, iPod, iPhone, and MacBook.
* His departure marks a significant shift for Apple, which is now taking on more design responsibilities without veteran members.
* The design team has lost several members in recent months, including key lieutenants Christopher Stringer and Daniele De Iuliis.
* Despite the departures, Apple is hiring younger designers and increasing the size of its design team to ensure a smooth transition.
* Ive's legacy will likely continue at Apple, with many products bearing his signature design style.

The article also mentions that Ive has been quoted as saying "the good way to leave Apple is to disappear and don't make press," implying that he wants to maintain some level of discretion around his departure. However, it's unclear whether this statement refers to his upcoming departure or a previous instance.
