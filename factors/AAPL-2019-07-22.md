The article discusses the potential benefits for Netflix stock (NFLX) due to increased competition from new streaming services like Disney+ and Apple TV+. The author argues that these services will not pose a significant threat to Netflix, as they are likely to focus on children's content or reruns, rather than original programming. Additionally, the pricing of these services is expected to be lower than Netflix's current offering, making it more accessible to a wider audience.

The author suggests that many Americans can afford multiple streaming services, and that higher-income individuals may cut their cable subscriptions but still be able to afford additional internet video subscriptions. This could lead to an increase in subscribers for Netflix, which would boost the stock price.

The article also mentions that if Netflix becomes twice as popular as Apple worldwide, its revenue could reach $72 billion per year, with a profit of $10 billion, and an earnings per share of $23. This would put the stock price at around $525, compared to the current price of $325.

Overall, the author is optimistic about Netflix's prospects and suggests that long-term investors should consider betting on the company's growth potential.
