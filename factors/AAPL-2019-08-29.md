The article discusses Apple's decision to start online sales in India, which is a significant move for the company. The new rules in India allow companies to source 30% of their production locally, but also include exports as part of the requirement. This change has benefited Apple, allowing it to meet local sourcing requirements and control its own retailing and branding.

The article highlights that Apple's online sales in India will be a big step forward for the company, as the country is a large market for smartphones. The phone maker's high prices and hefty import tariffs have made its products less accessible to average Indians, but with the new rules, Apple can now control its own retailing and branding.

The article also mentions that some of Apple's older devices are assembled in India by Taiwanese contractor Wistron Corp., while the latest iPhone X is tested in a factory near Chennai. The company has an insignificant share of the Indian smartphone market, but with this move, it may be able to gain more ground.

Overall, the article suggests that Apple's decision to start online sales in India is a positive step for the company, and will likely help it tap into a large and growing market.
