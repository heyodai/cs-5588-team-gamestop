The article discusses how Chinese consumers are increasingly looking to domestic brands when it comes to purchasing electronics and other products. According to a survey conducted by Prophet, a consultancy firm, 44% of Chinese consumers say they would consider buying from a brand that is "Made in China". This trend is being driven by nationalism and a desire for independence from Western brands.

Specifically, the article mentions that:

* Shenzhen Transsion Holdings Co., a Chinese handset maker, has priced its initial public offering at double the valuation of Apple Inc. (35.15 yuan a share vs 17.75 yuan a share).
* Li Ning Co., a sportswear maker, has cracked the top 40 for the first time, ranking No. 34.
* Patriotism is helping to fuel the rise of other Chinese brands, with some consumers interpreting the recent Huawei scandal as an attack on China.

However, not all Western brands are immune to this trend. Apple Inc., in particular, faces challenges in China due to its limited support for 5G networks and its lack of a popular streaming service that is available only in China (i.e. iQIYI). This has led to some consumers switching allegiances to local competitors.

As the article notes, "Some Western brands are so integral in the lives of Chinese consumers, they're almost predisposed to not losing relevance." This is because there are no strong alternatives to these brands in China, and therefore, they remain highly relevant.
