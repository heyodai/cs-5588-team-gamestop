Samsung Display plans to invest $11 billion by 2025 to upgrade its production line and address severe oversupply in the display industry, according to Bloomberg. The company is struggling with weak global demand for smartphones and TVs, which has led to a surplus of displays.

To combat this, Samsung Display will spend 10 trillion won ($8.7 billion) on facilities by 2025, and the remaining amount on research and development to produce more advanced display screens. This investment announcement comes at a time when South Korea's panel makers are facing challenges from slower LCD demand for TVs and smartphones, as well as rising competition from Chinese rivals.

Samsung Display is one of three main pillars in the company's business, alongside memory chips and smartphones. The company is a world leader in high-margin OLED displays but hit a snag last year when orders from Apple Inc. underwhelmed after the marquee iPhone XS fared worse than expected.

The company has been making a huge bet on the market as the business environment deteriorates and a trade spat between Korea and Japan creates uncertainty around the supply of chemicals and components necessary to manufacture advanced displays.
