The article discusses how Apple's latest iPhone 11 and 11 Pro models have surpassed Google's Pixel 4 smartphones in terms of camera capabilities, particularly in low-light conditions. The author argues that the Pixel 4 has lost its lead as a premium smartphone option due to its lack of significant improvements over previous models.

Some key points mentioned in the article include:

* Apple's iPhone 11 and 11 Pro cameras have closed the photography gap with better low-light image quality.
* Google's camera software, while improved, is not enough to compete with Apple's overall camera performance.
* The design of the Pixel 4 is utilitarian and lacks the polish of other flagship smartphones from Apple and Samsung.
* Battery life has become a major consideration for consumers, and the Pixel 4 lags behind comparable iPhone 11 models in this area.
* Google's marketing efforts have failed to create excitement around the new smartphone, despite its premium pricing.

The article concludes that Google's inability to compete with Apple on camera capabilities and design is a significant blow to its chances of success in the smartphone market. The author suggests that Google needs to fundamentally change its approach to designing and marketing smartphones if it wants to regain its position as a leader in the industry.
