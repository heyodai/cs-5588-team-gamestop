The article discusses Samsung's earnings report for the third quarter of 2022, which shows a significant decline in profit from its semiconductor business, which makes memory chips and logic processors. The company's profit fell by 78% to 3.05 trillion won ($2.6 billion), the lowest in over three years.

Samsung attributes this decline to weak seasonal effects and an increase in marketing expenses to address year-end smartphone sales. Despite this, Samsung's IT and mobile business saw revenue climb 17.4%, driven primarily by strong growth in smartphone sales, which reached 85 million units in the third quarter.

However, the article notes that higher marketing costs may impact the handset business in the fourth quarter, as shipments are expected to decline after the launch of new Galaxy models ends. The elephant in the room is stiff competition from Apple's latest iPhone and Google's new Pixel, both of which are getting rave reviews.

Samsung has been using its new folding displays as a way to flex its technology muscles, but it's unlikely that these will fill revenue gaps. Investors who believe in Samsung may be holding on to signals that the memory-chip business is ready to turn around, but management has expressed uncertainty about the market and the company's ability to recover.

The article concludes that Samsung's business model relies heavily on managing expectations and reinventing itself through technology, rather than driving revenue growth. While this approach can help the company navigate slow periods, it may not be a sustainable strategy in the long term.
