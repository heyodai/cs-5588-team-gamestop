The article discusses the issue of wildfires in California and how they are impacting the state's housing market. The author argues that the state's geography and ecology make it prone to wildfires, and that building new homes in fire-risk areas is not only reckless but also subsidized by the state and federal governments.

The article highlights several examples of new construction projects being approved in high-risk fire zones, including a 1,100-unit development in San Diego County and a 19,000-unit development in Los Angeles County. It notes that these developments are often built near roads that are prone to wildfires, making them particularly vulnerable to damage.

The author suggests that the state's top firefighter had floated the idea of banning construction in dangerous fire zones, but Governor Gavin Newsom is opposed to this approach. Instead, he favors better fireproofing and a focus on preserving California's "wilderness and pioneering spirit."

However, the article argues that this approach is not enough, as it does not address the root cause of the problem: building new homes in areas at risk of wildfires. It suggests that the state should prioritize building new housing in safe, high-density areas, particularly in major cities like San Francisco.

The author also notes that there will be resistance to this approach from homeowners who fear for their property values. However, they argue that the cost of inaction is already being felt, with billions of dollars spent each year on rebuilding and fire prevention efforts.

Overall, the article emphasizes the need for a more comprehensive approach to addressing California's housing crisis, one that prioritizes safety and sustainability over profit.
