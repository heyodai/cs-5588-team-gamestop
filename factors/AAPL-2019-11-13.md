The article discusses Disney's new streaming service, Disney+, which launched on November 12, 2020. The company is betting big on the platform, expecting to attract 90 million subscribers worldwide in five years and pricing it at $7 a month.

Disney has entered a crowded market already dominated by Netflix, Amazon.com, Apple Inc., AT&T Inc., and Comcast Corp. However, the company thinks its rich library of content, including "Star Wars," Marvel, and Pixar films, as well as 400 children's movies, will set it apart.

The service is designed around five main "tiles" named after Disney's key brands, with new programming announced for the first year alone, including a live-action "Star Wars" series. Unlike Netflix, which releases new seasons of programs all at once, Disney+ will put out one episode per week.

Disney is facing significant costs to launch and maintain the service, with losses more than doubling in the quarter that ended in September. However, the company's marketing efforts seem to have paid off, with over 86% of surveyed consumers having heard of the new service and nearly half likely to subscribe.

The article also notes that Disney is bundling its services together, offering a package that includes Disney+, ESPN+, and the ad-supported version of Hulu for $12.99 a month. This strategy aims to attract as many people as possible while generating revenue.

Overall, the article suggests that Disney's streaming strategy is a bold move to compete in a crowded market, but it may require significant investment and time to achieve its goals.
