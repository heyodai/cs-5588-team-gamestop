De La Rue, a UK-based company that provides identity and security solutions, is facing significant financial challenges. The company's market capitalization has declined by about 80% since 2017, and it is currently trading below its previous highs.

The company's bank overdraft facility of £275 million is due to expire at the end of 2021, and the covenants on this facility require that net debt does not exceed three times a measure of cash earnings. De La Rue came close to breaching this covenant at the end of September, which has raised concerns among investors.

In an effort to address these challenges, De La Rue has recently sold £40 million worth of assets, which has provided some relief. However, the company's board acknowledges that there are "plausible downside scenarios" that could still cause it to breach the covenant.

De La Rue's struggles highlight the challenges faced by companies in the identity and security space, particularly those that rely on traditional industries such as printing and labels. The rise of digital technologies has disrupted these markets, leading to declining sales and profits for many companies.

Despite its financial challenges, De La Rue remains committed to delivering long-term value to its shareholders. However, investors should exercise caution when considering the company's future prospects due to the significant risks it faces in a rapidly changing market landscape.

In terms of specific investment advice, I would not recommend buying De La Rue stock at this time due to its high volatility and significant financial challenges. However, I would encourage investors to keep a close eye on the company's progress and consider revisiting their investment decision if there are any positive developments or changes in the market landscape.

Ultimately, De La Rue's success will depend on its ability to adapt to changing market trends and technologies, as well as its commitment to delivering long-term value to its shareholders.
