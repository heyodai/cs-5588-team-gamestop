The article from Bloomberg discusses ByteDance Inc.'s new music app, Resso, which is being tested in emerging markets such as India and Indonesia. The app aims to challenge established paid music services like Spotify and Apple Music by offering features similar to TikTok, such as real-time lyrics and the ability to post comments under individual songs.

ByteDance, the owner of TikTok, has secured rights from Indian labels T-Series and Times Music, but still needs to secure deals with major record companies like Warner Music Group Corp., Universal Music Group, and Sony Music Entertainment. The company is testing Resso in a limited number of markets and is currently in a beta testing phase.

The article notes that ByteDance is looking to expand its revenue stream beyond advertising, which has been affected by a slowing home economy. By launching Resso, the company hopes to tap into the growing demand for music streaming services in emerging markets.

Some key points from the article include:

* Resso is available in India and Indonesia, two of Asia's most populous countries.
* The app has been installed by about 27,000 users across the iOS App Store and Google Play since its initial launch six months ago.
* ByteDance has secured rights from Indian labels T-Series and Times Music, but still needs to secure deals with major record companies.
* The company is testing Resso in a limited number of markets and is currently in a beta testing phase.

Overall, the article suggests that ByteDance is taking a strategic approach to expand its music streaming service into emerging markets, where there is growing demand for affordable music services.
