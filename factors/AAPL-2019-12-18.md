The article discusses Foxconn's plans to build a massive LCD plant in Wisconsin, but the company has reneged on its original plan and is now squabbling with the state over whether it will still be eligible for taxpayer subsidies. The Taiwanese company is now looking to operate a 6G factory, which would significantly change the scale of the project.

The article notes that Foxconn's decision to change plans may have been influenced by the fact that Japan's Sharp Corp., which Foxconn now owns, started production at a 6G fab 15 years ago, while the first 10.5G lines got underway only two years ago. The point is that Wisconsin officials believed a 10.5G plant was coming and were misled.

The article also notes that the contract agreed by WEDC (the organization tasked with luring investment to the state) may allow Foxconn to claim tax credits for work not actually performed in Wisconsin, which could be a problem if Foxconn doesn't meet its employment and capital expenditure targets.

The article concludes that both sides' willingness to patch things up is important, and that some marriage counseling is needed. The author notes that Foxconn's refusal to draw up a new contract leaves itself an excuse to walk away if its 6G plans don't get tax credits.

Overall, the article highlights the challenges of working with large companies like Foxconn, who may prioritize their own interests over those of the state and its residents.
