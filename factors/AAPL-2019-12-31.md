The article discusses how A2 Milk Co., a dairy company in New Zealand, has become the world's best-performing stock in the MSCI World Index, with a 16,150% return since its IPO in 2011. The company's success can be attributed to several factors, including:

1. **Growing demand for healthy food**: There is a renewed focus on healthier diets, and consumers are seeking out organic, vegetarian, and low-starch alternatives.
2. **China's growing appetite for dairy products**: China has become increasingly interested in importing high-quality dairy products from abroad, particularly from Australia and New Zealand, due to concerns over milk safety and quality.
3. **A2 Milk's unique selling proposition**: A2 Milk Co.'s product is made from cows that naturally produce only the A2 protein type, which may be easier for some people to digest.
4. **Successful e-commerce strategy**: The company has successfully tapped into e-commerce channels, including its official store on Alibaba Group Holding Ltd.'s TMall site.

However, the article also notes that:

1. **Investor enthusiasm is high, making the stock expensive**: A2 Milk Co.'s price-earnings ratio of 38-times is comparable to tech stocks, and investors may be overlooking some red flags.
2. **Recent resignation of CEO Jayne Hrdlicka**: The departure of a key executive may raise concerns about the company's leadership and direction.

Overall, the article suggests that A2 Milk Co.'s success is a reflection of changing global trends and consumer preferences, but also warns investors to be cautious given the high valuation and potential risks.
