Based on the provided news articles, here is an analysis of the outlook for the retail sector:

1. **Decline of brick-and-mortar stores**: The rise of online shopping and competition from Amazon has led to a decline in sales for many physical retailers, such as Macy's, which has been feeling the drag of losing sales since 2015.
2. **Shift to e-commerce**: The retail sector is shifting towards e-commerce, with companies like Walmart investing heavily in Flipkart, an Indian e-commerce retailer, to gain a stronger foothold in the market.
3. **Increased focus on supply chain management**: Companies are recognizing the importance of managing their products' supply chains more effectively, particularly in today's digital age where consumers can easily switch between channels and retailers.
4. **Growing demand for local advertising**: The US local advertising sector is expected to register its fastest annual growth in five years in 2018, driven by the increasing use of online platforms like Facebook and Instagram by small businesses.
5. **Competition from over-the-top internet television**: The TV industry is seeing an explosion of programming options brought on by the rise of over-the-top internet television, led by Netflix. However, consumers are becoming increasingly saturated with content choices, which could lead to a decline in demand for traditional TV services.

Overall, the retail sector is undergoing significant changes due to the shift towards e-commerce and digital platforms. Companies that can adapt and innovate will be better positioned to succeed, while those that fail to do so may struggle to remain relevant.
