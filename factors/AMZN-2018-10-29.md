Here are three falling FAANG stocks that investors may consider shorting this fall:

1. **Netflix, Inc. (NFLX)**: Despite its strong growth in recent years, Netflix's stock price has been under pressure due to increasing competition from streaming services such as Disney+, HBO Max, and Apple TV+. Additionally, the company's subscriber growth rate has slowed down, which may indicate a shift towards more profitable revenue streams.
2. **Alphabet Inc. (GOOGL)**: As Google faces increased regulatory scrutiny and rising costs associated with its cloud computing business, investors are starting to question whether the company can maintain its growth momentum. The stock price has been volatile in recent months, and some analysts believe that Alphabet's dominance in search advertising is under threat.
3. **Facebook, Inc. (FB)**: Following a series of scandals related to data privacy and misinformation, Facebook's reputation has taken a hit. This has led to increased regulatory scrutiny and declining user engagement, which may impact the company's ability to drive revenue growth. Additionally, the stock price has been under pressure due to concerns about the increasing competition in the social media space.

Note that shorting stocks carries significant risks, and it's essential to conduct thorough research and analysis before making any investment decisions.
