It appears that there are several news articles from different sources, but none of them seem to be related to each other directly. However, I can summarize the main points of each article:

1. **France will tax digital giants**: Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire announced that France will impose a national tax on digital giants starting in 2019, even if an EU-wide agreement is not reached.
2. **Cable stocks rise while streaming stocks fall**: The stock market has been experiencing a downturn in tech companies with exposure to the streaming video business.
3. **Kroger's Q3 earnings**: Kroger shares closed trading down 3.76% before the release of their third-quarter financial results, which may indicate that investors are nervous about the company's performance.
4. **Lululemon's Q3 earnings**: Lululemon shares have fallen nearly 12% in the last three months, sparking questions about whether this is a sign of investor nerves or simply part of the larger market decline.
5. **Amazon hires public affairs firms for New York HQ efforts**: Amazon has hired two public-affairs firms to help with media relations and strategy as it develops its second headquarters in New York City.
6. **Apple's HomePod heads to China**: Apple is set to enter the Chinese smart speaker market, potentially beating rivals like Google.

Overall, these articles cover a range of topics related to technology, finance, and business, but they are not directly connected to each other.
