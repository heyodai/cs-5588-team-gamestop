The article discusses Snapchat's struggles and the challenges it faces to improve its monetization and growth. Here are some key points:

1. **Monetization improvement is crucial**: To achieve profitability, Snapchat needs to increase its average revenue per user (ARPU), which has been rising due to a more mobile-heavy interface.
2. **Growing monetization won't be enough**: Despite the ARPU increase, Snapchat's growth remains stagnant, with daily active users only growing by less than 2% over the last five quarters. This suggests that monetization improvement may not be enough to drive growth.
3. **Niche market limitations**: Snapchat's niche market of primarily 13-24 year-olds and 25-34 year-olds is shrinking, making it harder for the company to grow.
4. **High dilution from employee stock options**: Despite revenue growth, Snap still loses money on a per-dollar-revenue basis due to high share-based compensation expenses.
5. **Competition from other giants**: Snapchat faces intense competition from advertising powerhouses like Facebook, Twitter, Alphabet (Google), and Amazon, which are expanding their own advertising platforms.

Overall, the article suggests that Snapchat's struggles to grow and improve its monetization may be a long-term challenge for the company. While ARPU is rising, it's unclear whether this will translate into significant growth or profitability in the near term.
