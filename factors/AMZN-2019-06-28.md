The article discusses the growing demand for European cloud encryption services as U.S. companies increasingly outsource their data to foreign providers, citing security concerns and regulatory issues. Several European firms, including Atos SA, are capitalizing on this trend by offering secure cloud storage solutions that meet EU data protection standards.

Atos, a French IT company, has signed contracts with several large corporations to provide secure cloud services, including Veolia and Societe Generale. The company's chairman and CEO, Thierry Breton, stated that European businesses want Google-like technology, but with the right protections. Atos has a pipeline of 1 billion euros ($1.1 billion) in security contracts under negotiation.

Other European companies, such as Thales SA and SAP SE, are also selling security products that sit between a company's data and its cloud provider. The article notes that Beijing-based database and cloud provider PingCAP is winning over local tech giants, startups, and financial institutions to its enterprise software.

The article concludes by stating that while U.S. companies such as Oracle Corp. and Salesforce have not seen significant knock-on effects from the trend, European companies are benefiting from the growing demand for secure cloud services. IDC researcher Carla Arend noted that the regulatory environment and global security risks are concerns for Europeans using hyper-scalers like Google.
