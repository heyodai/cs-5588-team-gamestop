The UK's Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) has issued an enforcement order to Amazon and Deliveroo, stating that it has "reasonable grounds" to believe they may have merged or will merge in the near future. The CMA is investigating whether Amazon's $575 million investment in Deliveroo would lead to a loss of competition in the UK food delivery market.

The initial review means that Amazon will not be able to close the deal, and both companies will have to continue acting as independent entities until the CMA completes its investigation.

Amazon has stated that its minority investment in Deliveroo is positive for consumers, as it would enable Deliveroo to expand its services and create new jobs. The company believes this investment would benefit consumers through increased choice and access to more restaurants.

Deliveroo's CEO Will Shu has expressed excitement about the potential benefits of working with Amazon, citing the e-commerce giant's operational and logistics expertise. He hopes to tap into Amazon's knowledge and experience to help Deliveroo grow its business.

The CMA notice states that during the review, there should be no integration of technology between the Deliveroo or Amazon businesses without consent from the regulator.

This news has implications for both companies, as it highlights the importance of competition in the UK food delivery market. The CMA's investigation will likely continue to monitor Amazon's and Deliveroo's activities, and any further developments could impact their business operations.

In summary, the CMA's enforcement order against Amazon and Deliveroo indicates that it is taking a close look at their potential merger or integration, which could have significant implications for both companies and the UK food delivery market as a whole.
