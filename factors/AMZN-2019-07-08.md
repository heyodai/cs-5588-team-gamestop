The article discusses the impact of SpaceX's Starlink satellite constellation on astronomy and the potential for interference with radio telescopes. The satellites are expected to be visible in the night sky due to their low altitude and could cause distractions for astronomers who rely on sensitive equipment.

Key points:

* The Starlink satellites will be visible in the night sky, potentially causing issues for astronomers.
* Astronomers using traditional radio telescopes may need to adjust to account for the increased background noise from the satellites.
* The International Astronomical Union has expressed concern about the potential impact of the satellites on astronomical observations.
* SpaceX plans to raise the satellites to an altitude of 342 miles, which should reduce their visibility in the sky, but it's not clear if this will be enough to mitigate the issue.

The article also mentions that there is a lack of international regulation and oversight for satellite constellations, which could lead to conflicts over issues like interference with astronomical observations.
