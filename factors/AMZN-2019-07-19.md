Indian Users Shun Paying for Content on Netflix

Netflix is struggling to convince Indian users to pay for its content, with many relying on free protocols such as torrent sites to access movies and TV shows.

According to Mihir Shah, vice president of media at Media Partners Asia, a consulting firm, Netflix wants to have one big original series coming out every month. In India, people are used to paying for Bollywood films, so the company hopes that if users are willing to pay $10 for a movie night, they will also subscribe.

However, Indian users have not accepted the idea of paying for content yet, Shah said. Two or three years ago, everybody relied on torrent sites to access free content. "Indian users have not accepted the idea of paying for content yet," he said.

Netflix didn’t disclose how much it’s spending on local content in India. It did announce the addition of five series, two of which are being produced by superstars Shah Rukh Khan and Anushka Sharma.
