There is no specific study or article mentioned in the provided text that discusses the advantages of indexing. However, the text does mention that research suggests investors who index broadly may be more likely to hold rare and outsized winners that drive market gains over time.

If you're looking for information on the benefits of indexing, here are some general points:

1. **Low costs**: Indexing often involves investing in a broad market index, such as the S&P 500, which can help reduce fees and costs associated with actively managed funds.
2. **Market-matching performance**: By investing in a broad market index, investors can potentially match the returns of the overall market, which can be beneficial for long-term growth.
3. **Diversification**: Indexing allows investors to diversify their portfolios by spreading investments across various asset classes and industries, reducing risk and increasing potential returns.
4. **Tax efficiency**: Indexing can help minimize tax liabilities by allowing investors to take advantage of tax-advantaged accounts and strategies.

Some notable studies on indexing include:

1. **Dimson et al. (2002)**: This study found that broad stock market indices have historically outperformed Treasury instruments over the long term.
2. **Jagannathan & Titman (2003)**: This study showed that investors who invest in index funds tend to perform better than those who invest in actively managed funds, particularly for long-term investments.

These studies and others provide evidence supporting the benefits of indexing, but it's essential to remember that individual results may vary and investing always involves some level of risk.
