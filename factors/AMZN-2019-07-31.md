The article discusses the potential for Qualcomm and Tencent to collaborate on a gaming device or console, leveraging their respective strengths in chip design and games. Here are some key points:

1. China's ban on consoles was lifted in 2015, but PC games have dominated the market since then, with Tencent Holdings Ltd. being the largest purveyor.
2. The article suggests that consoles haven't been able to gain traction in China due to ongoing distrust between China and Japan, which dominates console production (Nintendo).
3. Qualcomm is exploring new ways to tap into China's massive smartphone and games market, which is its second-largest market after the US.
4. The company has announced a tie-up with Tencent, a Chinese gaming giant, to develop Snapdragon-based mobile gaming devices, hinting at potential collaboration on a standalone portable gaming device or console.
5. This move could be seen as an attempt by Qualcomm to gain a foothold in China's growing gaming market and counter the dominance of PC games and Tencent.

The article concludes that while Sony and Nintendo may not push hard into China's console market, Qualcomm should consider collaborating with Tencent to tap into this lucrative market and stay competitive.
