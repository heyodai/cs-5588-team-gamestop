There is no clear answer to this question as it seems to be a discussion about Rite Aid stock and its potential value after a deal with Amazon. However, I can provide some insights based on the context.

The author of the article suggests that Rite Aid's stock might not have been affected by the initial enthusiasm around the Amazon Counter program, but rather by investors' concerns and cold feet. The author also mentions that the markets are giving management another chance, which could lead to a short-term trade idea being viable.

Based on this information, here are some possible takeaways:

1. **Rite Aid's stock might be undervalued**: Despite the initial hype around the Amazon Counter program, Rite Aid's stock price has been relatively stable. This could be due to investors' concerns or cold feet, but it also suggests that the company's underlying fundamentals might not be as weak as initially thought.
2. **Management is giving investors another chance**: The fact that management is still investing in the Amazon Counter program and promoting it as a way to attract new customers gives investors another reason to believe in Rite Aid's potential. This could lead to a short-term trade idea being viable.
3. **Short-term trade idea might be worth considering**: The author mentions that a measured short-term bet on Rite Aid stock isn't as crazy as it seems. If you're risk-tolerant, this could be an interesting opportunity to explore.

However, without more specific information about the deal with Amazon and Rite Aid's financials, it's difficult to provide a clear recommendation or estimate for the stock.
