Douyu is a Chinese live-streaming platform that has gained significant popularity in China, particularly among gamers. The company was founded by Chen Shaojie in 2014 and acquired Twitch-like streaming skills from the platform.

Tencent Holdings Ltd., another influential tech firm in China, dominates game streaming in China through its platforms Douyu and Huya. Tencent owns a majority stake in both companies. In contrast to Huya, Douyu's larger user base and more extensive game offerings are seen as advantages by Chen, who also holds a 13.3% stake in the company.

Douyu gained significant attention after signing top streamer Liu Kun, but some experts questioned whether revenue was inflated due to the practice of streamers spending their own money on fan support, which is then counted towards Douyu's revenue. The platform has faced censorship concerns as well, with regulators closely monitoring content deemed inappropriate or politically sensitive.

To address these issues and build a sustainable business model, Chen Shaojie is diversifying his company by opening a training camp to groom young streamers, establishing an esports club, and leading funding rounds for talent agencies that promote thousands of streamers. The company's share price has fluctuated in recent times, reflecting market volatility.

Despite the growth slowdown in China's game streaming industry due to short video apps like Douyin (the Chinese version of TikTok), Douyu remains a prominent player in the industry.
