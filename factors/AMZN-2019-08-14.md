The article discusses the potential impact of a delayed 10% tariff on $300 billion of Chinese imports on Taiwan-based contract manufacturers, particularly those involved in assembling electronic devices. The tariffs were originally set to take effect next month but have been postponed.

Taiwanese companies that rely heavily on China for production, such as Compal Electronics and Quanta Computer, are shifting some operations to other countries like Vietnam or rearranging their existing capacities in Taiwan. This move is likely a precautionary measure to mitigate potential losses if the tariffs were to be reinstated.

Experts believe that the delay will have little impact on these companies' contingency plans, which aim to diversify production and secure new customers. The uncertainty surrounding trade policies between the US and China has led many companies to explore alternative venues for their manufacturing operations.

The article highlights the broader implications of this trend, including the potential disruption to global supply chains beyond just China and the US. However, it's unlikely that Taiwan will become a dominant player in electronics production, given its current capacity constraints.
