The article discusses Amazon's efforts to bring its Alexa voice assistant into the automotive industry, but faces challenges from competitors like Google and the fact that many carmakers are opting for proprietary voice software instead of integrating Alexa. Here are some key points:

* Amazon has released tools that allow carmakers to build Alexa into their cars, but many have chosen not to use them.
* Fiat Chrysler Automobiles, Renault-Nissan-Mitsubishi, and Volvo are all building entertainment systems on Android, which is a competitor to Alexa.
* Google has built stronger ties with the auto industry, and its Assistant is becoming a popular choice for in-car voice control.
* Mercedes-Benz is using proprietary voice software instead of integrating Alexa or Google's Assistant.
* Amazon's Echo Auto, a device designed specifically for cars, was released last year but has had limited availability due to production issues.
* Reviewers have noted that the Echo Auto lacks polish and some of its auto-focused applications are not well-implemented.
* The device's connectivity can be spotty, forcing users to use their phones to skip songs or access Alexa's servers.
* Despite these limitations, some customers, like Ryan Adzima, who bought an Echo Auto to replace his outdated voice control system, have been satisfied with the device.

Overall, Amazon faces a competitive landscape in the automotive industry, and its efforts to bring Alexa into cars may not be as successful as it had hoped.
