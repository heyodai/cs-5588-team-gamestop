The article discusses how Amazon's Cloud Cam security camera, which can detect and alert users to activity in their homes, uses artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms trained on human-annotated footage. The AI is trained by teams of workers who manually annotate the footage, flagging any suspicious activity.

According to reports, these workers are located in India and Romania, where they use unencrypted customer videos to train the computer vision algorithms. This has raised concerns about privacy and data protection, as well as the potential for human oversight to be compromised.

The article also mentions that Amazon's human review teams, including those in India, have been criticized for not being transparent enough about their methods, which is why they might be sharing such content with other employees.
 
Additionally, this article highlights concerns around the use of AI algorithms trained on human-annotated data, particularly when it comes to sensitive information like facial recognition or voice recordings.
