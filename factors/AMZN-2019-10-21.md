The article discusses the challenges of valuing Saudi Aramco's initial public offering (IPO). The author argues that powerful insider interest groups have an inflated idea of the valuation they can achieve and are backing away when reality doesn't conform to their expectations. He also points out that the IPO has been handled in a way that creates perception of poor corporate governance, which is a concern for investors.

Some key points made by the author include:

1. Valuations have changed since the idea of an Aramco IPO was first mooted in 2016.
2. Major listed independent and state-controlled oil companies are trading at a discount to their valuations from 2016.
3. The perception of poor corporate governance, including the removal of key executives, may be a concern for investors.
4. The Saudi government needs an oil price of $78 a barrel to balance its budget, which is not currently happening.
5. Aramco has one giant advantage over WeWork - it has enormous cash flows that make an IPO unnecessary.

The author concludes that outside investors are not rushing to join the party because they are skeptical about valuations and perception of corporate governance. He suggests that Prince Mohammed should take the skepticism as a cue for reflection, rather than rejection.

Overall, the article highlights the complexities and challenges involved in valuing Aramco's IPO, and the need for transparency and good governance to win over investors' trust.
