The article discusses the issue of desertification, which affects 2 billion people worldwide and is a major contributor to climate change. The FAO has identified 900 million hectares of degraded land that could be restored by 2030, but the task will not be easy due to natural conditions and poor agricultural practices. The use of fertilizer is key to returning dry lands to vegetation, but misuse of fertilizers and other unsustainable practices have resulted in widespread degradation.

Some countries are taking steps to address the issue, such as Kenya's plan to plant 2 billion trees on 500,000 hectares to restore 10% of its forest cover. In Costa Rica, farmers are using deforested land to produce CO2-neutral coffee, and the country is replanting rainforest to encourage eco-tourism.

However, the challenge of desertification is significant, with over 20% of India considered wasteland and scarce water resources exacerbating the problem in Chile. The Atacama desert, which is home to the world's driest non-polar desert, is facing a severe drought, forcing fruit farmers to migrate south.

Despite these challenges, dozens of countries are fighting back with programs designed to reverse the loss of farmland and at least 20 nations have major efforts underway to replant lost forests. The FAO emphasizes that the problem is not about reclaiming deserts, but restoring wasteland that was productive before human intervention.
