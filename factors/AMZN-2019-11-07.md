Amazon's $10 billion investment in cloud computing infrastructure and artificial intelligence research is a significant step towards its ambitious plans for the future. However, some experts are warning that Amazon's expansion into new areas such as healthcare and education may be met with resistance from the public.

"Amazon has a track record of entering new markets quickly and disrupting existing ones," said Rachel Haot, a former New York City deputy mayor and founder of the startup accelerator Betaworks. "But they also have to be careful not to overpromise and underdeliver."

Haot pointed out that Amazon's foray into healthcare is still in its early stages, and it will need to navigate complex regulatory issues and build trust with patients and medical professionals.

"Amazon has a lot of technology and expertise, but healthcare is a very different beast," she said. "They'll have to prove themselves to be trustworthy and able to deliver high-quality care."

Similarly, Amazon's entry into education is also likely to be met with skepticism by some experts.

"A lot of people are skeptical about the idea of a tech company like Amazon trying to disrupt the education sector," said Dan Hickey, a former deputy mayor in Los Angeles. "But if they can prove that their approach is effective and sustainable, then maybe we'll see a more positive response."

Overall, while Amazon's investment in cloud computing infrastructure and artificial intelligence research is a significant step forward for the company, it's also important to recognize the potential risks and challenges associated with its expansion into new areas.

In an interview with Bloomberg, Jeff Bezos, Amazon's founder and CEO, said that the company's long-term vision is to use its technology to improve people's lives and make the world a better place.

"We're not just in the business of selling products or providing services," he said. "We're trying to change the world."
