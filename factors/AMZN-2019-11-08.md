This article discusses a potential record-breaking leveraged buyout (LBO) of Walgreens Boots Alliance Inc. by private equity firms. The proposed deal would require significant support from fund investors to cover the huge equity commitment, and analysts estimate that it could generate a 15% internal rate of return for the private equity firms involved.

The article highlights two key factors in making such a deal stack up:

1. **Leverage**: High levels of debt (up to six times Ebitda) are needed to justify the premium bid price.
2. **Devalued valuation**: Walgreens' stock market valuation is relatively depressed, providing an opportunity for private equity firms to acquire the company at a bargain price.

The article also notes that public share prices tend to dislike earnings volatility and restructuring charges associated with buyouts, which could contribute to the stock's relatively low valuation.

However, some might argue that public markets are missing out on Walgreens' potential due to general market fears about the healthcare sector and the disruption caused by Amazon.com Inc. The article concludes that a possible Walgreens megadeal may be "top-of-the-market recklessness," but long-term investors should consider the value proposition presented by private equity firms, who see their role as snapping up mis-priced assets.

Key points:

* A potential LBO of Walgreens Boots Alliance could generate a 15% internal rate of return for private equity firms.
* High levels of debt (up to six times Ebitda) are needed to justify the premium bid price.
* Public share prices tend to dislike earnings volatility and restructuring charges associated with buyouts.
* A possible LBO may be driven by market fears about the healthcare sector and disruption caused by Amazon.com Inc.
