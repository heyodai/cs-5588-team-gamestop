This article discusses the environmental impact of e-commerce returns, which are expected to reach a peak on January 2nd. The author argues that the industry's reliance on free returns and lenient return policies contributes to a hidden environmental crisis, with tens of millions of packages ending up in landfills and incinerators. The article suggests that retailers could adopt measures such as carbon-emission labeling, stop providing ready-made return labels, and experiment with "returnless refunds" for products that can't be sold again.
