The article discusses the recent acquisition of Delivery Hero's German arm by Takeaway.com, which was valued at around â‚¬800 million. The deal is notable for its high valuation multiple, equating to about eight times Woowa's 2019 sales. The author questions whether this level of valuation is justified and raises concerns that the merger may lead to a monopoly position in the food delivery market.

The author also mentions the potential investigation by the Korea Fair Trade Commission and the need for regulators to be cautious when approving such large deals, citing the example of Amazon's plan to invest in Deliveroo being blocked by Britain's Competition and Markets Authority.
