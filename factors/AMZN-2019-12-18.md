Uber Works, Uber’s staffing service for restaurants and warehouses, made a push into Miami to offer relief workers during the busy winter season. The city's Super Bowl in February added to the demand for temporary workers. Uber recently tested the service in Miami before its wider rollout.

In Miami, Uber Works hired five workers to cook, clean and do laundry for a local bed and breakfast, Copper Door B&B. The manager, Jamila Ross, said the work and prices were excellent. She had always relied on friends and family to fill temp work until Uber came calling. "They had some of the best cocktail napkin fans I'd seen," she said.  “They made the venue look tight.”
