Here's a summary of the available fixes for those huge chip hacks:

1. **Meltdown**:
	* Affects laptops, desktop computers, and internet servers with Intel chips.
	* Could let hackers steal data, such as passwords saved in Web browsers.
	* Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O), Apple Inc (AAPL.O), and Linux are issuing updates.
2. **Spectre**:
	* Affects laptops, desktop computers, smartphones, tablets, and internet servers with Intel, AMD, and ARM chips.
	* Could allow hackers to steal sensitive information from vulnerable devices.
3. **Intel Deal With Widespread Computer-Chip Weakness**:
	* Intel Corp is working with Microsoft Corp to fix the vulnerabilities.
	* The deal involves a software patch that will be released by Intel and Microsoft.
4. **Most Processors Produced Since 1995 Have a Flaw That Could Let Hackers Steal Sensitive Information**:
	* Researchers have discovered two security flaws, Meltdown and Spectre, in most computer chips produced since 1995.
	* These flaws could potentially affect personal computers, mobile devices, and cloud servers.

To stay safe, consider the following:

1. **Update your operating system**: Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O), Apple Inc (AAPL.O), and Linux are issuing updates to fix the vulnerabilities.
2. **Use a reputable antivirus software**: Antivirus software can help detect and prevent malware that may be related to these vulnerabilities.
3. **Be cautious when using public Wi-Fi**: Public Wi-Fi networks may not be secure, so consider using a virtual private network (VPN) to encrypt your internet traffic.
4. **Keep your software up-to-date**: Regularly update your software, including browser plugins and other applications, to ensure you have the latest security patches.

Remember that these vulnerabilities are widespread and affect many devices, so it's essential to take steps to protect yourself and your data.
