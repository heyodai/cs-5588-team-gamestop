Microsoft has announced a major reorganization, establishing two main divisions:

1. **Experiences and Devices**: This division will be headed by Rajesh Jha, with Scott Guthrie moving to a different role within the company.
2. **Cloud and AI Platforms**: This division will continue under the leadership of Scott Guthrie.

Additionally, there are mentions of other news in the tech industry, including:

* Square's growth drivers in 2018
* Google's efforts to catch up with IBM and Microsoft in blockchain technology
* DocuSign filing for an IPO (initial public offering)
* Take-Two's strong game portfolio driving its business
* A former Microsoft manager landing a role with the Responsible Cobalt Initiative
* Apple's new iPad release not solving its core problem in the classroom

However, these points seem unrelated to the main announcement about Microsoft's reorganization.
