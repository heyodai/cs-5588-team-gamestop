Based on the provided news articles, here are the top 5 factors that may affect the stock price of MSFT (Microsoft):

1. **Cloud Computing Trends**: The rise of cloud computing giants like Amazon and Salesforce.com grabbing a bigger share of enterprise IT spending suggests a shift in demand towards cloud-based services. As Microsoft is also investing heavily in its Azure cloud platform, this trend could positively impact its stock price.

2. **Trade Wars and Tariffs**: The ongoing trade war between the US and China, with new Trump tariffs on $34 billion worth of Chinese imports going into effect last week, could lead to increased costs for MSFT, which does business with China. This could negatively impact its stock price if the trade tensions escalate.

3. **Google's Loon Project**: Microsoft has partnered with Google's Loon project to provide internet services in rural areas. While this partnership is expected to increase Google's presence in the market, it may also divert some of MSFT's resources and attention away from its own cloud computing efforts, potentially affecting its stock price.

4. **Equifax Stock Performance**: Equifax, a major data analytics player, has seen its stock recover significantly after suffering a huge loss of consumer data nine months ago. This unexpected recovery could create an opportunity for investors to buy MSFT's shares at a lower price due to the increased competition in the data analytics space.

5. **Rural Internet Expansion**: Google's Loon project winning a contract to provide internet services in Kenyan rural areas highlights the growing demand for high-speed internet, particularly in underserved regions. This trend could create new opportunities for MSFT to expand its cloud computing and internet services offerings, potentially benefiting its stock price.

Note that these factors may have varying degrees of impact on MSFT's stock price, and it's essential to consider other market trends and company-specific news when making investment decisions.
