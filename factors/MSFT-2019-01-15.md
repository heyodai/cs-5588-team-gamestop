The article discusses Alibaba's stock and its relationship to Altaba (NASDAQ:AABA), the former Yahoo. The author argues that investors should not view Alibaba as an analog to Amazon, citing its unique value proposition as a software company focused on moving markets from the 19th to the 21st century.

Key points:

* Altaba is holding 383 million Alibaba shares, worth about $57 billion, but its market cap is just $38 billion.
* This gives investors a pure play on Alibaba stock, with no income generated by Altaba itself.
* The author notes that this only gives investors Alibaba stock "second-hand" and that they are waiting for the board to monetize the stake for them.
* However, if Alibaba wants to sell some of its shares, it will have to pay a premium to Altaba.
* The author concludes that Alibaba is not an Amazon analog and should be viewed as a unique company with its own strengths and weaknesses.

The article also mentions that investors may consider Altaba (NASDAQ:AABA) as a way to get into Alibaba's stock at a discount, but notes that this comes with risks such as waiting for the board to monetize the stake and potentially losing value.

Overall, the article suggests that investors should approach Alibaba with caution and view it as a unique company with its own strengths and weaknesses, rather than trying to force it into an Amazon analog framework.
