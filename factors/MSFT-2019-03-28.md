**Adobe Stock Update**

* Adobe's acquisition of Magneto and Marketo has expanded its reach in the cloud services market.
* The company recently announced a partnership with Microsoft to tap into LinkedIn's network for B2B marketing and sales.
* This expansion strengthens Adobe's long-term growth fundamentals.

**Valuation and Technicals**

* Adobe stock trades at 30 times forward earnings, which is reasonable considering strong growth projections.
* A golden cross pattern on the technical front suggests that Adobe stock is back to its winning ways after a late 2018 sell-off.

**Broader Market Update**

* The broader market fell yesterday due to fears of a possible US economic slowdown.

These updates suggest that Adobe's growth prospects remain healthy, and the company's recent acquisitions and partnerships are contributing to its success. However, the broader market is facing concerns about an economic slowdown, which may impact the performance of various stocks, including Adobe's.
