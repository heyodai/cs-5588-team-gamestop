The article provides a comprehensive analysis of Lyft's growth prospects and its potential for achieving significant profits in the next decade. Here are some key takeaways:

1. **Market share**: Lyft's market share is expected to settle around 35%, which would be nearly double its current share. This could lead to a large user base, with 70 million riders by 2030.
2. **Ride volume**: The number of rides per year could exceed 5.6 billion by 2030, up from 40 rides per rider in 2016. This growth would be driven by increasing demand for ride-sharing services as consumers use them more frequently for everyday transportation.
3. **Bookings and revenue**: Bookings per ride are expected to grow to $16-17 by 2030, leading to bookings of $90 billion to $100 billion. Revenues could reach north of $30 billion, with a contribution margin of 55% and an operating margin of 15%.
4. **Valuation**: Lyft's valuation is currently around $20 billion, which is seen as undervalued given its growth prospects. A forward multiple of 20 would imply a fiscal 2019 valuation target of $30 billion.

Overall, the article suggests that Lyft has strong fundamentals and a solid growth trajectory, making it a compelling investment opportunity. However, it also notes that the market leader, Uber, had significant setbacks in recent years, which may not be repeated by Lyft. As such, investors should exercise caution when considering this stock.
