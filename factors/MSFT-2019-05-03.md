It appears that you want me to change the digital signage to promote more sales. 

Here are a few ideas:

1. **Limited-time offer**: Create a sense of urgency by announcing a limited-time offer, such as "Get 10% off your next purchase" or "Buy one item, get one free."
2. **New product announcement**: Highlight a new product or service that's recently launched, such as "Introducing our newest menu item: the Spicy Chicken Sandwich!"
3. **Special promotion**: Offer a special promotion, like "Kids eat free with the purchase of an adult meal" or "Show this digital signage at checkout to receive 10% off your total bill."
4. **Seasonal offer**: Take advantage of seasonal events, such as "Valentine's Day specials" or "St. Patrick's Day deals."
5. **Personalized message**: Use a personalized message to engage with customers, such as "Happy birthday to our loyal customer, [Name]!"
