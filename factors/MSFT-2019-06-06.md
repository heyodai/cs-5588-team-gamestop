The article discusses three software companies that have seen growth and are undervalued: National Instruments (NATI), Symantec Corporation (SYMC), and Electronic Arts (EA). Here's a summary:

1. **National Instruments (NATI)**:
	* Has experienced significant growth in recent years, with EPS nearly tripling last year.
	* NATI stock traded under $30 per share just three years ago but now sells for around $40 per share.
	* Its forward P/E is 29.6, and the five-year estimated PEG ratio is 0.64, indicating a relatively low valuation compared to its growth potential.
2. **Symantec Corporation (SYMC)**:
	* Has been focusing on network and cloud security, offering protection for financial applications through its acquisition of LifeLock.
	* SYMC stock has seen slower growth due to declining PC sales but is expected to rebound in 2020 with a projected EPS increase of 8%.
	* The stock trades at a discount, with a current forward P/E of around 10 and a history of high income growth.
3. **Electronic Arts (EA)**:
	* As a gaming company, EA might seem like an unlikely candidate to benefit from GameStop's struggles.
	* However, the article suggests that EA's stock could be a good bet due to its growth potential and relatively low valuation.

The article concludes by suggesting that these software companies offer compelling value propositions to investors, with NATI and SYMC potentially being takeover targets or attractive buys.
