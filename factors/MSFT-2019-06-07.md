The article discusses Amazon's stock performance and its potential for growth. Here are the main points:

1. **Amazon's forward price-to-earnings (PE) ratio has fallen to 45**, which may not seem high but is considered low when considering the company's expected growth.
2. **Wall Street forecasts a 35.4% increase in profits this year and 39.8% in fiscal 2020**, with a five-year average prediction of 94% average annual growth, making it one of the most promising growth stocks.
3. **Amazon's market cap is around $850 billion**, but recent news and market trends may have hurt the stock price, causing it to trade in a range since April last year.
4. **Cloud services and online ads have helped keep profit growth at or above 40% per year**, which may indicate that earnings will continue to increase in the future.
5. **The recent multiple compression suggests that Amazon's stock floor is established around $1,500**, giving traders a reason to buy the stock.

Overall, the article suggests that Amazon's stock has potential for growth and may test its current trading range of $1,500 but is unlikely to fall below it.
