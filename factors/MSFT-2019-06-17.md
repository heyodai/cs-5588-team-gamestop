The article discusses how the release of next-generation Xbox consoles, Project Scarlett, may not have a significant impact on Microsoft's (MSFT) stock price. While the console launch will generate buzz and attract some new customers, it is unlikely to substantially boost MSFT stock prices. The company's revenue from gaming is still relatively small compared to other divisions, such as "More Personal Computing" (which includes Windows operating system, Surface tablets, search engine revenue, etc.), which generated $42.7 billion last fiscal year.

However, the article notes that Microsoft's cloud business is growing rapidly and has become a significant contributor to the company's success. The analyst Daniel Ives recently highlighted this growth potential, stating that Microsoft is closing the gap with Amazon (AMZN) in enterprise-level cloud business.

The article concludes that while the next-generation Xbox consoles may not be a game-changer for MSFT stock prices, they are still an attractive investment opportunity due to the company's overall strong financial performance and growing cloud business.
