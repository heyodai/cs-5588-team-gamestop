The article discusses the changing landscape of cloud computing and the role of network operators in providing cybersecurity solutions. With the rise of edge computing, network operators are facing a challenge as more businesses turn to cloud providers for their cybersecurity needs. The article highlights three different approaches taken by network operators:

1. Cloud-based security: This approach involves using third-party clouds to provide cybersecurity solutions, such as encryption keys and access controls.
2. On-premises security: This approach involves providing cybersecurity solutions on a business's own premises, rather than relying on a third-party cloud provider.
3. Hybrid approach: This approach involves combining elements of both cloud-based and on-premises security, using server boxes that sit on customers' premises to provide a hybrid of local and cloud computing.

The article notes that the rise of edge computing is particularly challenging for network operators, as it reduces their role in providing data transmission services. However, some network operators are responding by developing new cybersecurity solutions that can be used with edge computing, such as AWS Outposts and Azure Stack.

Overall, the article suggests that network operators will need to adapt to changing market conditions and find ways to remain relevant in a rapidly evolving cloud computing landscape.
