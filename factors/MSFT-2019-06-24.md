Based on the text, it appears that there are several investment opportunities in solid blue chip stocks that can benefit from a prolonged trade war and weak global economic outlook. The Dow is set to experience its best June in 80 years due to the Fed's hints at a rate cut later this year.

Five blue chip stocks to consider investing in are:

1. Microsoft (MSFT) - with a record intraday high for the fifth-straight day, and a market cap of $1.054 trillion.
2. Cisco (CSCO) - mentioned in the Zacks Analyst Blog Highlights article as a top pick.
3. Twitter (TWTR) - also mentioned in the same article as a top pick.
4. Akamai (AKAM) - another stock highlighted in the Zacks Analyst Blog.
5. Cadence Design (CDNS) - a blue chip stock with a strong technical backdrop.

Investors are encouraged to consider these stocks given their bullish technical outlook and top-down tailwinds based on the technology sector's potential to drive the S&P 500's secular advance over the coming quarters to years.

Additionally, Google is investing $1.1 billion in new data centers in the Netherlands, taking advantage of the country's sustainable energy sources and cooler climates that help reduce air conditioning costs.
