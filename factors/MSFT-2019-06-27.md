Huawei has won a case against CNEX, a startup that accused the Chinese tech giant of stealing trade secrets. The jury found in favor of CNEX, ruling that Huawei did not steal any sensitive information from the company. Huawei's former employee, Yiren "Ronnie" Huang, was found guilty of violating his employment agreement's patent application disclosure provision, but not of theft. The verdict is a significant victory for Huawei in its ongoing trade conflict with the US and China.
