This article discusses the brain drain of European tech talent to the US, citing Google's acquisition of several European startups as an example. The author argues that Europe is losing ground in the global race for talent due to the lure of venture capital and the ability to poach engineers from these companies.

Some key points made in the article include:

* 562 European startups were bought by US firms between 2012 and 2016, or 44% of the total.
* The international talent pool for AI is alarmingly shallow at about 205,000 people, making it a scarce resource.
* Europe's politicians seem complacent in confronting these issues, seeing investment from Silicon Valley as an unalloyed economic good rather than a threat to national power.
* The author suggests that tougher antitrust scrutiny and hybrid public-private partnerships could help address the issue.
* A European version of DARPA (Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency) is also proposed as a solution.

The article concludes by stating that Europe's AI and deep tech exodus will continue until its political leaders take the issue seriously, specifically addressing the brain drain of talent to the US.

There are 4 mistakes in this passage:

1. The mistake is not immediately apparent, but upon re-reading the passage, it becomes clear that the first sentence ("Google announces that it will be commissioning a new subsea cable, namely Equiano, in a bid to further boost cloud computing infrastructure.") does not match the rest of the article. It appears to be an out-of-context statement and should probably be removed or integrated into the main text.

2.  The author's opinion on Google's acquisition of DeepMind is subjective and may be seen as biased against Google's actions. However, this bias is implicit and might be considered a minor mistake in terms of objectivity.

3.  The article assumes that the EU has not taken measures to counter the US tech giants' acquisitions of European startups. It would have been helpful if the author had acknowledged any efforts made by the EU to address these issues before making their case for change.

4.  While the idea of a European version of DARPA is an interesting one, it seems more like a tangential comment than a main argument point. A clearer connection between this idea and the rest of the article would be beneficial.
