The European Commission is launching a new initiative to stimulate investment in the battery industry and make Europe a major player in global production. The goal is to build enterprises that can supply automakers without requiring imports from Asia, which currently dominates production. Measures being taken include:

1. France and Germany working together to channel billions of euros into the battery industry.
2. The European Investment Bank giving preliminary approval for a 350 million-euro loan to support NorthVolt AB's bid to build a battery gigafactory in Sweden.
3. The European Bank for Reconstruction & Development working on a "raw materials investment facility" to build a supply chain for rare Earth metals needed for batteries.
4. The EU starting a 100 million-euro Breakthrough Energy Ventures fund with Microsoft Corp.'s Bill Gates and other investors to advance the energy transition, which is likely to include batteries.
5. Gathering at least 260 industrial companies in an alliance aimed at building capacity to make energy storage devices in Europe.

By 2025, Europe aims to control 11% of global battery cell manufacturing capacity, up from 4% now, according to BloombergNEF analyst James Frith. This will pare back China's market share and rival the US's command of the industry. The EU estimates the battery market may be worth 250 billion euros a year by then.

The initiative is driven by Germany, which lost control of the solar industry in the last decade to Chinese companies backed by government loans. Economy and Energy Minister Peter Altmaier is focused on the 800,000 jobs in Germany tied directly to car manufacturing, and wants to build the best battery cells in the world in Europe.

NorthVolt CEO Peter Carlsson said the company plans to accelerate its plans to create a new Swedish industry that will have a big impact in cutting dependence on fossil fuels. The European Battery Alliance is seeking to coordinate research that will be the foundation of the plan.

The goal is to make Europe a major player in global battery production, and to support companies like BMW and Volkswagen AG as they increase electric car production.
