Based on the article, it appears that Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) is gaining ground on NVIDIA (NVDA) in the semiconductor market. AMD has pulled off a near-miraculous turnaround under the leadership of CEO Lisa Su, and its Navi-based RX 5700 and RX 5700 XT chips are showing improved performance and power efficiency compared to NVDA's offerings.

The article highlights several factors that could contribute to AMD's success:

1. Innovation: AMD has been focused on innovation, which is driving its growth.
2. Pricing: AMD has reduced the pricing of its chips, making them more competitive with NVDA's offerings.
3. Competition: The competition between AMD and NVDA is driving innovation and improvement in both companies.

However, the article also notes that there are still risks associated with NVDA stock, including:

1. Trade tensions: The ongoing trade tensions between the US and China could impact NVDA's business.
2. Slower growth: China's economic slowdown could weigh on NVDA's business.
3. Competition from other tech giants: Other tech giants like Alphabet (GOOGL), Microsoft (MSFT), and Amazon (AMZN) are also building their own chips, which could pose a threat to NVDA.

In terms of valuation, the article notes that NVDA is trading at a reasonable price-to-earnings multiple of 22. However, the author recommends holding off on buying NVDA stock in the near term due to the uncertainty surrounding AMD's growth and the potential risks associated with NVDA's business.

Overall, the article suggests that the semiconductor market is becoming increasingly competitive, and both AMD and NVDA will need to continue to innovate and improve their offerings to stay ahead.
