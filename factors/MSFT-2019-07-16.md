Amsterdam, the tech hub of Europe, is taking a break from building new data centers due to concerns over its property market and power networks. The city's government has suspended all approvals for new data center investments until the end of the year, citing an unsustainable demand for space and electricity.

The Dutch Data Center Association was dismayed by the decision, stating that the excellent infrastructure is a magnet for tech companies and brings employment opportunities. Microsoft and Alphabet's Google have already built large data centers in the region, with plans to expand their operations.

Amsterdam has been eager to attract tech companies due to its attractive taxes and relatively cheap electricity. The city's real estate market has seen record prices, driven by demand from companies and individuals moving to Amsterdam after Brexit. However, this surge in demand is putting pressure on the city's commercial property and housing markets.

The government aims to take stock of the situation and formulate policy to ensure data centers occupy minimal space and fit well with the environment. To address concerns over residual heat, the city plans to make it available for free for heating homes and green energy use.

As a result, tech companies may need to consider alternative locations for their operations. The decision highlights the challenges of balancing economic growth with sustainability and infrastructure development in rapidly growing cities like Amsterdam.
