This article discusses the financial performance of Advanced Micro Devices (AMD), a company that produces computer processors and other chips. Here are some key points:

1. **Disappointing Q3 sales forecast**: AMD reported revenue of $1.8 billion for the third quarter, which missed analysts' expectations.
2. **Game-console chip demand**: The company's revenue from game-console chips declined 12% in the second quarter, citing weak demand from Microsoft and Sony, its two biggest customers.
3. **Shift to server processors**: AMD is trying to shift focus away from low-margin PC chip sales and towards higher-margin server processor business, which has been a growth area for the company.
4. **Increased competition with Intel**: The article notes that AMD's CEO, Lisa Su, aims to regain share lost to Intel, which still dominates the processor market.
5. **Gross margin improvements**: AMD reported a wider gross margin of 41% in the second quarter, up from 37% last year, which is expected to increase further to 42% for all of 2019.

The article suggests that AMD's stock price fell about 5% after the earnings report due to the disappointing sales forecast and weak game-console chip demand. However, Su expressed confidence in the company's performance, citing a strong pipeline of new products and customer engagements.
