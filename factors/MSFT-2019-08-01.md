Based on the text, it appears that Amazon (AMZN) is considered a prime stock to buy now by many analysts. The $2,281 average analyst price target suggests sizable upside potential of 22%, indicating that the stock may be undervalued and ripe for a purchase.

Additionally, the company's strong Q2 earnings report, which beat expectations, has fueled bullish sentiment among analysts. Some have referred to it as a "buying opportunity" due to its ability to leverage technology infrastructure to drive new industry verticals and incremental sales growth.

However, it's worth noting that Amazon's recent weakness was attributed to a shortfall in earnings due to significant incremental investments in delivery speed and supply chain improvements. Despite this, many analysts remain bullish on the company's prospects and see it as an attractive stock to buy now.

Other stocks mentioned, such as Visa (V), UnitedHealth (UNH), and Comcast (CMCSA), also have a positive outlook according to the Street, with strong earnings reports and high analyst ratings.
