The article discusses the growing trend of vulnerability disclosure programs (VDPs) in the cybersecurity industry, where companies invite hackers and security researchers to report potential security flaws in their systems. These programs have become more formalized as the volume and severity of threats has increased.

Some notable examples mentioned in the article include:

* HackerOne, a platform that connects companies with security researchers, has received at least 30 reports of security flaws since its inception in January.
* Apple Inc. offers bug bounties up to $50,000 for pointing out vulnerabilities in its iCloud account data and secure boot firmware components.
* Microsoft Corp. has doubled its top bounty reward to $40,000 for finding bugs in Azure.
* Goldman Sachs Group Inc. has had a private disclosure program in place since January 2018 and has awarded over $40,500.

The article also highlights the risks associated with VDPs, such as the potential for hackers to come across sensitive information or damage the system. However, many companies believe that these programs are an effective way to identify security flaws and improve their overall cybersecurity posture.

Some key quotes from the article include:

* "You have to filter it out pretty carefully before you realize what's real and what's not," said Dave Aitel, chief technical officer at Cyxtera Technologies.
* "Even if Capital One offered cash rewards, it's not clear that the unnamed tipster would have netted a huge reward. That's because the information provided was more of a heads-up about a leaked data, rather than a detailed report outlining a major flaw," said Aitel.

Overall, the article suggests that VDPs are becoming an increasingly important part of a company's cybersecurity strategy, and that they can provide valuable insights into potential security flaws.
