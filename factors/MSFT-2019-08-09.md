JD.com (NASDAQ:JD) stock price has been trending upwards since November 2019, with a double-bottom formation at $19.25 in November and December. The stock has shown resistance at $26, which is also the 61.8% retracement of the one-year range. If the trade news deteriorates, the level may give way, potentially leading to a decline into the $23 area.

Valuation:
JD's valuation is relatively high compared to other stocks in its class. Analysts expect sales growth of 17% this year and next year, but the bottom line has struggled. The company lost more than half a billion dollars in 2016 and had a loss of over $350 million in fiscal 2018.

Conclusion:
While JD.com is not a bad company, it lacks size and momentum compared to other mega-cap tech companies like Alibaba (BABA), Alphabet (GOOGL), Amazon (AMZN), and Microsoft (MSFT). Investors who want exposure to the Chinese e-commerce market may find JD attractive, but it's essential to be aware of its valuation challenges.
