The article discusses the recent development of the Joint Enterprise Defense Infrastructure (JEDI) cloud contract, which aims to provide a unified and secure IT infrastructure for the US Department of Defense. The author argues that the Department needs to move quickly to complete these investigations and award the contract to Amazon Web Services (AWS), despite external pressure.

The author highlights several key points:

1. Efficiency at scale: JEDI's efficiency in managing large-scale resources will be crucial for the Department, especially considering its size and budget.
2. Resiliency and security: By storing data in a cloud structure, the Department can reduce its vulnerability to cyber threats and improve overall security.
3. One-stop shopping: The contract would provide a single point of contact for all IT operations, streamlining processes and reducing complexity.
4. Operational capabilities: Warfighting in the 21st century will require "brain on brain" combat, where data is processed quickly and efficiently.

The author also mentions that Secretary Esper has limited options and should press through to award the contract despite external pressure. They note that anti-Amazon influence from the White House may be a factor, but this might not be significant enough to outweigh the benefits of the contract.

Overall, the article presents a positive case for Amazon Web Services winning the JEDI contract, citing the company's strengths in cloud computing and its potential to improve the Department's efficiency, security, and operational capabilities.
