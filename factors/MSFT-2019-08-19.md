The article discusses SoftBank Group Corp.'s Vision Fund 2, which is struggling to secure funding due to a lack of external investors. Despite announcing an eclectic mix of investors last month, the fund still faces significant funding gaps. In response, SoftBank plans to lend employees as much as $20 billion to buy stakes in the venture-capital vehicle, with interest rates ranging from 5% and minimal down payments required.

The article highlights several concerns with this approach:

1. **Desperation**: The fact that SoftBank is turning to its own employees for funding suggests a lack of confidence in the fund's ability to secure external investments.
2. **Internal ownership structure**: By lending employees money to buy stakes, SoftBank may be creating an internal ownership structure that can lead to conflicts of interest and favoritism towards certain employees.
3. **Lack of diversity**: The article notes that most investors in Vision Fund 2 are industry buddies or Japanese banks, with no prominent international sovereigns or institutional investors.

The author suggests that this approach is a sign of desperation and that SoftBank will likely scrape together the remaining funding by casting a wider net and making appeals to potential investors. However, the author doubts that many investors will be enthusiastic about investing in Vision Fund 2 compared to the first fund, which had a clear lead investor and significant support from international sovereigns and institutional investors.

Overall, the article raises questions about SoftBank's strategy for raising funding for its Vision Fund 2 and whether it is relying too heavily on internal sources of capital.
