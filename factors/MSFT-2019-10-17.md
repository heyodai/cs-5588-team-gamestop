Based on the news articles provided, here are the top 5 factors that may affect the stock price of MSFT (Microsoft):

1. **Cloud Computing Growth**: Microsoft's cloud computing business has been a major driver of its growth and success. The company's recent investments in Azure and Office 365 have led to increased adoption by businesses and consumers alike.

2. **Brexit Deal**: A potential Brexit deal could provide a boost to MSFT's stock price as the UK's exit from the EU could lead to increased demand for Microsoft's cloud-based services, particularly among British businesses.

3. **Women in Leadership**: Companies with more women in leadership positions have been shown to outperform their peers financially. As a result, Microsoft's increasing representation of women in its C-suite and board of directors may positively impact its stock price.

4. **Partnerships and Acquisitions**: Microsoft's partnerships and acquisitions, such as its recent partnership with Nuance Communications and its acquisition of GitHub, have been key drivers of its growth and innovation. New partnerships and acquisitions could further boost the company's stock price.

5. **Earnings Season Performance**: As a leader in the cloud computing space, MSFT's earnings season performance is closely watched by investors. Strong quarterly results and positive guidance from management can send MSFT shares higher, while weak results or disappointing guidance can lead to downward pressure on the stock price.

These factors are not exhaustive, but they represent some of the key areas that could impact MSFT's stock price in the near term.
