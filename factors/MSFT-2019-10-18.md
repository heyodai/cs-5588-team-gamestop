The article discusses Virta, a technology company based in San Francisco that was affected by the MeToo movement and its handling of sexual harassment allegations within the organization. The company's CEO, Ilkka Inkinen, was criticized for his response to one of the complaints, which some felt downplayed the severity of the situation.

The article highlights the following key points:

* Virta put out an employee handbook in April 2018 outlining a policy against harassment, but lacked a head of HR and did not share the results of an investigation into allegations of sexual harassment with staff.
* Two female employees, including Wali, filed complaints about Scahill's behavior, which were investigated by an attorney from an employment law firm. The resulting report described allegations of inappropriate comments and touching as credible.
* Despite the investigation's findings, Wali was still asked to continue reporting to her original supervisor, who had allegedly made her feel uncomfortable.
* Wali took time off to process the news and later quit, citing a lack of accountability and transparency in the company's handling of harassment complaints.
* Virta executives eventually apologized for their mistakes and asked Scahill to resign.
* The incident led to several other employees quitting, citing a loss of faith in the company's commitment to employee welfare.

The article suggests that Virta's handling of the situation was inadequate and that the company failed to prioritize the emotional safety of its workers.
