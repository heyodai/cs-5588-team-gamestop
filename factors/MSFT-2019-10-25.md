The article discusses Amazon's recent financial results, including its investment in one-day delivery and the growth of its cloud computing unit, Amazon Web Services (AWS). The company reported a 28% decrease in profit to $2.1 billion, but a 24% increase in revenue to $70 billion. However, this increase was largely driven by increased spending on shipping costs, technology, and content.

Some key points from the article include:

* Amazon's shipping costs rose 46% to $9.6 billion in the third quarter.
* The company offers one-day delivery on more Prime items, which has contributed to its online sales growth of 21%.
* AWS's growth was the slowest since Amazon began breaking out the unit's performance, sparking concern among investors.
* Despite this, many analysts see the stock as a buying opportunity due to its long-term growth prospects.
