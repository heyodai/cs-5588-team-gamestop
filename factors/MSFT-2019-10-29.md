The article discusses Convoy, a digital freight broker that aims to outdo established trucking companies and ride-hailing giant Uber. The company's goal is to reach better-than-industry economics on each market it enters, and its newly expanded auction system, called Direct to Shipper, is part of this strategy.

Convoy allows drivers to bid on every single load, rather than just a limited number of jobs as in the past. This could increase options for drivers by a factor of 10, according to Convoy's chief product officer, Ziad Ismail. The system is more like eBay than Uber, and it has already saved shippers like Waiakea Springs, a Hawaiian maker of bottled water, money on their shipments.

Convoy also agrees to help shippers achieve environmental goals, such as switching to all-electric vehicles, by connecting them with green trucking companies. The company's dedicated account representative for Waiakea Springs ensures smooth service and finds the best prices, something Uber Freight wouldn't do for a small customer like Waiakea Springs.

However, some experts worry that pitting drivers against each other to offer the lowest rate could further depress prices. Ismail suggests that truckers can make up for an earnings shortfall in volume if they have more options available to them.

The article also mentions Convoy's recent win of a $10 billion cloud-computing contract from the Defense Department, which is only one example of its growing business.

Overall, the article highlights Convoy's ambitious goals and strategies to outdo established players in the digital freight brokerage market.
