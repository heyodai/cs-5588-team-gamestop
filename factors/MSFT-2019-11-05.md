The article discusses the challenges faced by Indian-American immigrants in the United States, particularly when it comes to obtaining employment-sponsored green cards, which are used to sponsor permanent residence permits. The author argues that the current system is biased against large countries like India and China, and proposes a few solutions to address this issue.

To summarize the main points:

* The U.S. currently admits too few skill-based immigrants, with only 13% of available green cards going to Indians despite over half of requests coming from them.
* The country cap system is deeply biased against big countries like India and China, limiting the number of green cards they can receive.
* A solution could be to eliminate the country cap or increase the number of employment-sponsored green cards, making the extra cards not subject to country caps.

The article concludes that increasing the number of green cards available for skilled immigrants would benefit both the U.S. and large countries like India, allowing more talented individuals to live and work in America.
