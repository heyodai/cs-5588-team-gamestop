The article discusses the recent changes made by Instagram, Twitter, and Amazon, including the removal of like totals on posts. While these changes are intended to reduce the impact of social media on mental health and increase user engagement, they may not necessarily address the underlying issues.

Instagram's decision to remove like totals is seen as a weak attempt to mitigate the negative effects of social comparison, but it still allows users to view their own post likes with an additional tap. Twitter's change is similarly limited, allowing users to conceal replies but not fundamentally altering the nature of the platform's discourse.

Amazon's move to display customer rating totals instead of review totals may be an attempt to reduce the impact of third-party sellers attempting to manipulate reviews through paid promotions. However, this change may also have unintended consequences, such as making it easier for fake or biased reviews to spread.

Tristan Harris, co-founder of the Center for Humane Technology, criticizes these changes as "tying a pinkie behind its back," implying that they do not go far enough to address the broader issues with social media and digital platforms.

A more optimistic view is that these changes represent a start towards addressing the negative effects of social media. As Harris notes, "it's fine and great that they are changing some of the feedback loops." However, it remains to be seen whether these changes will have a significant impact on user behavior and mental health outcomes.

Overall, the article suggests that while these changes may be a step in the right direction, they are not yet sufficient to address the complex issues surrounding social media and digital platforms.
