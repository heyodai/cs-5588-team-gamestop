The article discusses Canopy Growth stock (CGC) and its potential for a turnaround in 2020.

The article highlights the following points:

* Canopy Growth stock has been trending lower for several months, but now shows signs of strong support.
* The company's price chart is showing a Fibonacci-based, two-step or mirror move pattern, which suggests that a big-time turnaround may be on the horizon.
* The second leg of the two-step pattern completed near $18.50 in October and aligned with a 76% retracement level.
* A bullish hammer candlestick formed earlier this month, confirming the bottom.
* The author recommends taking CGC stock's limited but volatile technical exposure one step further by exiting if shares fall beneath $17.
