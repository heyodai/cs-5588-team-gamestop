Based on the provided news articles, here are the top 5 factors that may affect the stock price of NVDA (NVIDIA):

1. **Cloud Computing and AI Demand**: NVIDIA's dominance in the cloud computing and AI markets is a significant driver of its growth. As demand for these technologies continues to rise, NVIDIA's stock price is likely to benefit.

2. **Cryptocurrency Miner Demand**: The company's exposure to the cryptocurrency boom has been a major factor in its recent growth. However, this trend may be less pronounced in the future, which could impact NVDA's stock price.

3. **Competitor Response to AI and GPU Market**: With companies like AMD and Intel launching their own AI and GPU products, there is increasing competition in the market. NVIDIA's ability to maintain its market share and pricing power will be crucial in determining its stock price.

4. **Seasonal Sales**: As mentioned earlier, NVIDIA experiences a strong holiday season sales period, which contributes significantly to its overall revenue. If this trend continues or if NVDA can capitalize on other seasonal opportunities, its stock price may benefit.

5. **Time Value and Options Trading**: The recent availability of new options contracts for NVDA's May 18th expiration has increased the time value component of the stock price. This could lead to increased volatility and potential price movements in the short term, affecting NVDA's stock price.
