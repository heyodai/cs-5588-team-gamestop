Here are the top 5 factors that may affect the stock price of NVDA:

1. **Cryptocurrency Mining**: The use of Nvidia's GPUs in cryptocurrency mining has been a significant contributor to its growth and popularity. However, if a new chip from Bitmain Technologies can steal some of the functionality of GPUs, it could impact NVDA's sales.
2. **Artificial Intelligence (AI) Business**: NVIDIA's AI business is a major driver of its growth and profitability. The company has reported powerful results for its fourth quarter and fiscal year 2018, with quarterly revenue jumping 34% and adjusted earnings per share EPS soaring 52%.
3. **GPU Supply Shortage**: The prolonged cryptocurrency boom has created a shortage of GPUs, leading to high prices at third-party retailers. This has limited access to fairly priced GPUs for games, creating pent-up demand.
4. **US Tax Reforms**: The US tax reforms have had a positive impact on NVIDIA's stock price, as the company is exposed to both the good and bad of the cryptocurrency boom.
5. **Competition from AMD**: Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) has been gaining ground in the GPU market, which could impact NVDA's sales if AMD is able to steal some of its share.

Note that these factors are not exhaustive and may have other implications for the stock price of NVDA.
