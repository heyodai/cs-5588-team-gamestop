Based on the news articles provided, here are the top 5 factors that may affect the stock price of NVDA (Nvidia):

1. **Crypto Mining Decline**: The decline in the economics of crypto mining due to the high price of ether ($185 or more) required for mining using Nvidia or AMD graphics chips. This could lead to a decrease in demand for Nvidia's GPUs used in crypto mining.
2. **Competition from AMD**: The emergence of AMD as a competitor to Nvidia in the GPU market, which may reduce Nvidia's market share and profit margins.
3. **Shift to Cloud Gaming**: The shift towards cloud gaming, which may reduce the demand for high-end gaming PCs and GPUs like those used by Nvidia.
4. **China's Rise in AI and 5G**: China's growing dominance in AI and 5G technology may increase competition for Nvidia's products in these areas, potentially reducing demand for its GPUs.
5. **Earnings Growth and Guidance**: The company's earnings growth and guidance will be a significant factor in determining its stock price. A strong Q2 earnings report and positive guidance could lead to an increase in the stock price, while disappointing results or guidance could negatively impact it.

Note that these factors are not exhaustive and may have other implications on NVDA's stock price as well.
