Based on the news articles, here are the top 5 factors that may affect the stock price of NVDA (Nvidia):

1. **New Ray Tracing Technology**: Nvidia's brand-new ray tracing technology is poised to alter the growing multibillion-dollar video gaming industry for good. This has led to a significant increase in shares of NVDA, with prices climbing over 2.2% on Tuesday morning.
2. **Self-Driving Car Regulations and Safety Concerns**: The recent accident involving an Uber self-driving vehicle has raised questions about the regulation and safety of self-driving technology. As a supplier of technology for self-driving cars, NVDA's stock price may be affected by any delays or concerns related to these regulations.
3. **Increased Demand for AI Technology**: Nvidia is a leading manufacturer of graphics processing units (GPUs) used in artificial intelligence (AI) applications. The company's recent financing round and announcements about its new hardware may indicate increased demand for its products, which could drive up the stock price.
4. **ETF Inflows and Market Trends**: Noteworthy ETF inflows into the Technology Select Sector SPDR Fund (XLK), including NVDA, suggest that investors are increasingly optimistic about the tech sector. This trend may lead to a positive impact on NVDA's stock price.
5. **Global Gaming Industry Growth**: The growing multibillion-dollar video gaming industry is expected to drive up demand for high-performance graphics processing units like those made by Nvidia. As the company's new ray tracing technology becomes widely adopted, NVDA's stock price may benefit from increased revenue and growth prospects.
