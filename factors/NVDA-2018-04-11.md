Based on the news articles provided, here are the top 5 factors that may affect the stock price of NVDA (NVIDIA):

1. **Cryptocurrency Mining Business**: NVIDIA and AMD earn significant revenue from cryptocurrency mining, with estimates suggesting around 20% of AMD's revenue comes from this source. A decline in cryptocurrency prices or an increase in competition could negatively impact their stock prices.

2. **Competition from Chinese Alternative**: The emergence of a Chinese alternative to AMD and NVIDIA's GPUs (graphics processing unit) for use in crypto mining has raised concerns among investors, particularly Susquehanna analyst Christopher Rolland, who downgraded NVIDIA's stock due to this development.

3. **Trade Tensions with China**: Calming trade tensions between the US and China have contributed to a positive market sentiment, which may positively impact NVIDIA's stock price. However, ongoing trade tensions could still pose a risk to the company's revenue and profitability.

4. **Earnings and Revenue Growth**: NVIDIA's earnings and revenue growth are closely watched by investors, who may be affected by any changes in these metrics. A decline in revenue or earnings growth could lead to a decrease in stock price.

5. **Industry Trends and Competitor Activity**: The semiconductor industry is highly competitive, with many companies vying for market share. Any changes in industry trends, competitor activity, or new product launches could impact NVIDIA's stock price and overall market sentiment.

Note that these factors may have varying levels of impact on NVDA's stock price depending on the specific news article or event.
