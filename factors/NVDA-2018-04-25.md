Based on the provided news articles, here are the top 5 factors that may affect the stock price of NVDA (NVIDIA):

1. **Automotive Sales**: NVIDIA's Tegra processor business saw a huge boost in fiscal 2018 due to automotive sales, which is expected to be a significant contributor to their growth.
2. **Competition from AMD**: Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) is gaining traction in the professional graphics market, and its Vega GPUs are now being used in gaming notebooks and workstations. This competition may impact NVIDIA's share price.
3. **Crypto Mining**: The crypto mining industry is a significant contributor to AMD's revenue, but it has also been a concern for investors due to volatility. If crypto mining continues to be a small but growing part of NVDA's revenue, it could impact their stock price.
4. **Trade War with China**: A trade war between the US and China has had negative implications for many companies, including AMD. NVIDIA's business is also closely tied to China, which may affect its share price.
5. **Supply Chain Constraints (Truck Driver Shortage)**: The shortage of truck drivers affecting chip manufacturers like NVIDIA could lead to supply chain disruptions, potentially impacting their stock price.

These factors highlight the importance of considering a diversified portfolio and staying informed about industry trends and market conditions when investing in NVDA or any other company.
