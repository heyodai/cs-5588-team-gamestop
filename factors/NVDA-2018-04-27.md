Based on the provided news articles, here are the top 5 factors that may affect the stock price of NVDA (NVIDIA):

1. **Supply chain issues and competition**: NVIDIA has a supply problem due to its constant creation of new uses for its graphics processing units (GPUs). This may lead to increased competition from AMD and Intel in the GPU market, affecting NVDA's stock price.
2. **Autonomous driving technology and AI applications**: As the company with arguably the biggest exposure to autonomous driving technology, NVIDIA's performance in this area can significantly impact its stock price. The US government is also considering tightening grip on China ties related to artificial intelligence, which may affect NVIDIA's business practices and stock price.
3. **Partnership with Chinese companies**: NVIDIA's partnerships with Chinese companies, particularly in the field of artificial intelligence, have raised concerns about intellectual property theft and technology transfer to China. Scrutiny from the US government and Congress may lead to increased regulatory pressure on these partnerships, affecting NVDA's stock price.
4. **Competition with AMD**: Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) has been skeptical about NVIDIA's GeForce Partner Program (GPP), which could reduce its competitiveness in the GPU market. A potential decrease in competition may benefit NVDA, but also increases uncertainty and market volatility.
5. **Earnings reports and quarterly performance**: The recent impressive first-quarter earnings report from AMD sent shares higher, indicating that investors are closely watching the performance of major technology companies. Similarly, NVIDIA's share price has seen gains despite any major catalyst, suggesting that investors are optimistic about the company's future prospects.

These factors may influence NVDA's stock price, but it is essential to conduct thorough research and consider multiple perspectives before making investment decisions.
