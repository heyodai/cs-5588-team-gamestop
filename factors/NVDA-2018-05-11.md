The article discusses Nvidia's quarterly earnings report, which beat expectations due to strong sales from cryptocurrency miners. The company reported adjusted profit of $2.05 per share and revenue that topped Wall Street forecasts. However, the good news was tempered by the fact that Nvidia revealed an increasing reliance on volatile cryptocurrency mining activity, which has led to a slowdown in the market.

The article highlights several key points about Nvidia's earnings report:

1. **Strong sales from cryptocurrency miners**: Nvidia reported strong sales from its graphics processing units (GPUs) used for cryptocurrency mining, with revenue jumping 68% year-over-year.
2. **Beating expectations**: The company's adjusted profit of $2.05 per share was above the consensus estimate of $1.47 a share.
3. **Increasing reliance on cryptocurrency mining**: Nvidia revealed that it sold $289 million in chips to cryptocurrency miners in the first quarter, and the outlook isn't particularly rosy due to the volatility of the market.
4. **Mixed reaction from investors**: The stock price fell in pre-market trading after the earnings report, but rebounded as stock futures rose.

The article also discusses other news stories that may impact Nvidia's stock performance:

1. **AT&T and Novartis trying to save face**: The Michael Cohen story is widening, and AT&T and Novartis are trying to distance themselves from the controversy.
2. **Cisco Systems pulls online ads from YouTube**: Cisco announced that it will stop running online ads on YouTube in an effort to avoid being associated with hate speech or extremist content.
3. **JPMorgan Chase revamps stock trading business**: JPMorgan Chase is reportedly planning to overhaul its stock trading business, which could have implications for the financial industry as a whole.

Overall, the article suggests that Nvidia's strong earnings report was overshadowed by concerns about the volatility of the cryptocurrency market and the company's reliance on it.
