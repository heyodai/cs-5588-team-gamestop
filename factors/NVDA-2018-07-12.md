Based on the news articles provided, here are the top 5 factors that may affect the stock price of NVDA (Nvidia):

1. **Autonomous Vehicles**: Nvidia's partnership with Daimler and Bosch to use its DRIVE Pagasus platform for autonomous taxis has the potential to boost the company's stock price. As autonomous vehicles become more prevalent, demand for Nvidia's technology is likely to increase.
2. **Server CPU Market**: Nvidia's server CPU business has shown significant growth in recent years, and analysts expect this trend to continue. Strong performance in this market could drive up NVDA's stock price.
3. **Artificial Intelligence (AI) Space**: As AI continues to advance, the demand for specialized graphics processing units (GPUs) like those used by Nvidia is likely to increase. This could lead to increased investor confidence and a higher stock price.
4. **Tariff Wars**: The ongoing global tariff war between the US and China has been a significant market concern for technology companies like NVDA. Any change in trade policies or escalation of tensions could impact Nvidia's stock price.
5. **Earnings Announcements**: As with many stocks, NVDA's stock price is sensitive to its earnings announcements. Stronger-than-expected financial results or positive guidance from management could drive up the stock price, while disappointing results could lead to a decline.

These factors are not exhaustive and may interact with each other in complex ways. It's essential for investors to conduct thorough research and consider multiple perspectives before making investment decisions.
