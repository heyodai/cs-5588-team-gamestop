Based on the provided news articles, here are the top 5 factors that may affect the stock price of NVDA (Nvidia):

1. **Trade War Impact**: The ongoing trade tensions between the US and China may negatively impact Nvidia's GPU sales, as the company is heavily reliant on the Chinese market for its gaming business.
2. **Cryptocurrency Market Fluctuations**: Changes in the cryptocurrency market can affect the demand for GPUs, which are widely used in cryptocurrency mining. A decline in the cryptocurrency market could lead to a decrease in GPU sales and subsequently impact NVDA's stock price.
3. **Gaming Industry Trends**: The gaming industry is evolving rapidly, with more gamers seeking high-performance laptops and PCs. If Nvidia fails to keep up with these trends, its stock price may suffer as a result.
4. **Broadcom Acquisition Rumors**: Although the articles do not explicitly mention NVDA's stock price being affected by Broadcom's acquisition rumors, the negative sentiment surrounding the deal could lead to a decline in NVDA's stock price if investors become concerned about the potential impact on the company's GPU business.
5. **Competition from AMD**: The increasing competition between Nvidia and AMD (Advanced Micro Devices) may negatively affect NVDA's stock price, particularly if AMD is able to gain significant market share in the gaming and high-performance computing markets.
