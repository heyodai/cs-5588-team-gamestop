Based on the news articles provided, here are the top 5 factors that may affect the stock price of NVDA (Nvidia):

1. **Increasing demand for AI and autonomous vehicle technology**: With companies like Volvo introducing autonomous vehicles and NVIDIA's strong position in the AI space, there is a high likelihood that NVDA's stock will continue to outperform.

2. **Expansion of NVIDIA's product portfolio and profit margin growth**: The company's expanding product portfolio and improving profit margins are expected to drive long-term growth and increase investor confidence.

3. **US-China trade tensions and their impact on the tech sector**: While Apple's products were spared in the latest round of tariffs, the tech sector as a whole is still vulnerable to changes in US-China relations. This could lead to volatility in NVDA's stock price.

4. **Strong end-market demand driving Micron's (MU) Q4 earnings**: A strong demand for memory chips from Micron Technology is expected to drive its Q4 earnings, which could have a positive impact on the tech sector as a whole and potentially influence NVDA's stock price.

5. **Competition from Broadcom (AVGO)**: While Broadcom has had impressive growth in recent years, it may not be as well-known or widely recognized as NVIDIA's strong position in the AI space. This could lead to increased competition for market share and affect NVDA's stock price.
