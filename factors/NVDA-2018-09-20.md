Based on the text, it appears that Nvidia's stock has fallen 1.6% in premarket trading after Morgan Stanley downgraded the gaming card stock, citing mixed data points in gaming performance. The analyst, Joseph Moore, said that performance improvements in older games are not as hoped for and that new features such as ray tracing and DLSS will matter more in the long term.

However, it's worth noting that Nvidia's stock is still up 46% over the past 12 months, and the PHLX Semiconductor Index has risen 19% during that time. Additionally, growth of ETFs holding NVDA is favorable, with net inflows of $25.97 billion, indicating a positive sentiment among investors.

The overall tone of the article suggests that Nvidia's stock may experience some volatility in the short term due to mixed data points, but the company's long-term prospects and recent performance suggest that it remains a promising investment opportunity.
