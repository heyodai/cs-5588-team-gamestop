Based on the news articles provided, here are the top 5 factors that may affect the stock price of NVDA (NVIDIA):

1. **Interest Rate Hikes**: The Federal Reserve's interest rate hike in October led to a sell-off in semiconductor stocks, including NVIDIA, indicating that investors are sensitive to changes in monetary policy and its impact on the tech industry.
2. **Trade Tensions with China**: Growing trade tensions between the US and China have had an impact on semiconductor stocks, including AMD (Advanced Micro Devices) and Intel, as they are exposed to the Chinese market. This could lead to a decline in NVIDIA's stock price if the situation escalates further.
3. **Artificial Intelligence Adoption**: As AI adoption continues to grow, investors may become more optimistic about NVIDIA's prospects due to its dominance in the field of graphics processing units (GPUs) and artificial intelligence computing hardware.
4. **Competition from AMD**: The recent upgrade by Nomura Instinet to "buy" from neutral for Intel stock suggests that analysts are starting to see opportunities in the competition between NVIDIA and AMD, which could lead to a decline in NVIDIA's stock price if AMD gains significant market share.
5. **Semiconductor ETF Outflows**: The outflow of money from semiconductor ETFs such as the VanEck Vectors Semiconductor ETF (SMH) suggests that investors are becoming more cautious about the sector, which could lead to a decline in NVIDIA's stock price as investors adjust their expectations.

Note: These factors may not be exhaustive and may have varying levels of impact on NVIDIA's stock price.
