Based on the provided news articles, here are the top 5 factors that may affect the stock price of NVDA:

1. **Economic growth expectations**: A downgrade in GDP growth expectations from the Atlanta Fed (from 3.5% to 2.6%) and a negative print for national housing prices (Case Shiller) may negatively impact NVDA's stock price.

2. **Federal Reserve interest rate talk**: Hard talk about interest rates from Federal Reserve Chair Jay Powell and other market participants may influence investor sentiment and affect NVDA's stock price, particularly if the company is perceived as vulnerable to changes in interest rates.

3. **China trade tensions**: A hard-line speech by Vice President Mike Pence on China (on October 4) and overall China trade tensions may negatively impact NVDA's stock price, particularly if the company relies heavily on Chinese customers or suppliers.

4. **ETF inflows and outflows**: Large inflows into ETFs like QQQ, which hold NVDA, may positively affect the stock price due to increased investor demand and optimism about the market.

5. **JPMorgan's upgrade to overweight**: JPMorgan's upgrade of NVDA to "overweight" from neutral, along with a positive view on the company's long-term story and an attractive entry point after a pullback, may positively impact the stock price as investors become more optimistic about the company's prospects.

Note that these factors are not exhaustive, and other news articles or market trends may also influence NVDA's stock price.
