1. **Competition from AMD**: The emergence of Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) as a strong competitor in the server CPU and GPU markets could potentially threaten NVIDIA's market share and lead to a decline in its stock price.

2. **Turing-based RTX 2080 Ti GPU concerns**: The recent issues with NVIDIA's Turing-based RTX 2080 Ti GPU, including the stock reaching its 52-week high only to plummet later, may indicate potential problems with the technology that could negatively impact investor sentiment and drive down NVDA's stock price.

3. **Chip industry slowdown worries**: Concerns about a chip industry slowdown due to a tech-spending binge coming to an end, as well as worries about demand for semiconductor chips, could lead to decreased investor confidence in NVIDIA's ability to maintain its growth trajectory and result in a decline in its stock price.

4. **Self-driving car market competition**: The rise of self-driving cars and the increasing importance of semiconductor technology in this field may lead to increased competition among chip stocks, including NVDA. As investors flock to companies involved in this emerging market, NVDA's stock price could be affected by concerns about its position in this space.

5. **Global economic uncertainty**: Economic uncertainties, such as changes in interest rates and global trade policies, can have a ripple effect on the technology sector, leading to decreased investor confidence and downward pressure on stocks like NVDA.
