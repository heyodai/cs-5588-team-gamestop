Here are the top 5 factors that may affect the stock price of NVDA (NVIDIA Corporation) based on the provided news:

1. **Concerns about the market for graphics cards used in videogames**: Morgan Stanley's price target for NVIDIA stock has been lowered due to concerns about the market for graphics cards, which could impact the company's gaming business.

2. **Federal Reserve interest rate hike in December**: The approach of another Federal Reserve interest rate hike in December may cause investors to take a more cautious stance on stocks, including NVDA, leading to potential downward pressure on its stock price.

3. **Loss of near-term growth due to mid-term election results**: The mid-term election results and the fading hopes for bipartisanship between President Trump and House Democrats may lead to a post-election market rally looking vulnerable to profit taking, which could negatively impact NVDA's stock price.

4. **Near-term weakness in its core gaming market**: Despite the company's growth potential in other markets, near-term weakness in its core gaming market due to competition or changes in consumer behavior could affect NVDA's stock price.

5. **Decreased earnings expectations for the upcoming report**: Wall Street expects a year-over-year increase in earnings on higher revenues when NVIDIA reports results for the quarter ended October 2018. However, the company may not meet these expectations, leading to potential downward pressure on its stock price.
