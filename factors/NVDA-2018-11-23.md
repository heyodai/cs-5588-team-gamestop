Based on the news articles provided, here are the top 5 factors that may affect the stock price of NVDA:

1. **Revenue Growth Concerns**: NVIDIA's revenue growth guidance has been missed by analysts twice in a row, and the company's recent earnings report did not impress investors, leading to a 28% drop in stock price.

2. **Cryptocurrency Impact**: The decline in cryptocurrency prices may have contributed to NVIDIA's weak guidance for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019. As a major player in the gaming industry, which is heavily influenced by cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, NVIDIA's stock has been negatively affected.

3. **Competition from Other Chipmakers**: NVIDIA faces stiff competition from other chipmakers like Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) and Texas Instruments, which have also reported weak guidance for their fourth-quarter revenue.

4. **Guidance Cuts**: NVIDIA's recent earnings report included a guidance cut, which may have raised concerns among investors about the company's ability to meet its future growth targets.

5. **Valuation and Moving Average Crossover**: The stock's valuation may be a concern, as it has dropped by 42% over the past three months. Additionally, the 50-day moving average for NVDA broke out below the 200-day simple moving average, suggesting unfavorable trends on the technical front.

These factors may contribute to downward pressure on NVDA's stock price and make it more challenging for investors to buy the stock at current levels.
