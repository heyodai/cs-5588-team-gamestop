Based on the news articles provided, here are the top 5 factors that may affect the stock price of NVDA (NVIDIA):

1. **Surplus Customer Inventory**: Micron Technology's CEO stated that customers had built up excess inventories, which led to reduced demand and weak earnings guidance. This could lead to a decrease in NVDA's stock price as it is one of Micron's key customers.

2. **Trade War and Global Economic Uncertainty**: The article mentions Apple being the "most sensitive" company to the US-China trade war, but it also implies that global economic uncertainty could affect tech stocks like NVDA. A slowdown in global demand or supply chain disruptions could impact NVDA's stock price.

3. **Competition from Intel**: Intel's strong data-centric business growth and its ability to operate without a permanent CEO may pose a threat to NVDA's dominance in the market. This increased competition could lead to a decrease in NVDA's stock price as investors become more cautious about the company's prospects.

4. **Soft Demand for Memory and Storage Solutions**: Micron Technology reported weak industry demand-supply dynamics, which led to weaker-than-expected guidance for Q2 2019. This softness in demand may also impact NVDA's revenue growth, leading to a decrease in its stock price.

5. **Bearish Reaction to Fed Announcement**: The extremely bearish reaction to the Federal Reserve announcement may lead to a decline in tech stocks like NVDA as investors become more cautious about the future of the sector. This increased uncertainty could lead to a decrease in NVDA's stock price.
