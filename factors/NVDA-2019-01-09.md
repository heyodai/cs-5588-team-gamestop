The article discusses Intel's (INTC) potential for growth and recovery, citing an analyst upgrade by Bank of America Merrill Lynch. The company's low multiple and increasing sales, despite a glut in available chips, are reasons for the upgrade. Additionally, Intel's exposure in emerging technologies such as 5G, artificial intelligence (AI), automotive, and the Internet of Things (IoT) is expected to drive growth.

The article highlights several new product releases by Intel, including:

1. Cascade Lake, a 9th generation Xeon processor available now.
2. Ice Lake, a new PC and data center processor that will be the first 10nm platform.
3. Snow Ridge, a 5G processor that will take Intel into the wireless base station market.

Intel's product lines are being repositioned to focus on emerging technologies, rather than traditional PC sales.

The article concludes that Intel is poised for growth and recovery, with new products and technologies driving profits higher. It suggests buying Intel stock before it becomes widely recognized as a leader in the tech industry.
