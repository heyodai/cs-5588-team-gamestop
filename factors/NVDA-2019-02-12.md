According to Oppenheimer analyst Rick Schafer, NVDA (Nvidia) is still bullish on the company ahead of its Q4 earnings release. Here are some key points from his analysis:

1. **Revised FQ4 guidance**: NVDA revised its fourth-quarter revenue guidance $500 million lower due to lingering "Pascal-crypto drag," but Schafer believes this weakness will be transitory.
2. **Datacenter (DC) segment impact**: The DC segment accounts for 25% of revenue and is expected to be impacted by spending cuts from hyperscalers as they digest capacity. However, Schafer sees a recovery in the DC segment in the second half of the year.
3. **Turing GPU shortfalls**: NVDA's next-gen Turing GPU has been impacted by soft demand, primarily due to China's economic slowdown and nascent RTX gaming content. Schafer believes these issues are temporary and that NVDA's dominant position in AI training accelerators will remain secure.
4. **Secular growth and GM expansion**: Schafer highlights NVDA's secular growth opportunities, particularly in the gaming segment (56% of sales), and its significant greenfield growth potential in the nascent inference market.
