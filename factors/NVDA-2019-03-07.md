The article discusses the current state of Western Digital's (WDC) stock and the semiconductor industry, highlighting the potential risks and opportunities for investors.

Key points:

1. WDC's fiscal third quarter earnings guidance is for an 80%+ decline in earnings due to high inventories at key cloud customers.
2. The company's COO, Cordano, believes that the issue is with inventories not aligning with demand, rather than a fundamental shift in the market.
3. Datacenter demand and connected home markets are expected to drive growth in the memory industry.
4. WDC has already cut its capacity, which, combined with increasing demand, should lead to a recovery in the industry.

However, there are also concerns:

1. Management's optimism about the future may be premature, as the chip space has historically not timed cycles well.
2. The stock may not be the best play due to WDC's market share declines since its 2016 acquisition of Sandisk and the presence of more attractive valuations in other stocks.

Overall, the article suggests that investors should approach WDC's stock with caution and consider alternative options in the chip sector.
