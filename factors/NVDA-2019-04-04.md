The article discusses Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) stock and its recent rally. The author concludes that while AMD has strong long-term growth fundamentals, the valuation is currently too optimistic and due for a reset.

Key points:

1. **Market share gains**: AMD has been gaining market share in the CPU and GPU markets, particularly on Intel and Nvidia.
2. **Valuation concerns**: The current price of $30 is considered overvalued, with a forward price-earnings multiple of 20x, which is average for growth stocks.
3. **Long-term growth prospects**: AMD's share of the global chip market could reach 3% by 2025, and gross margins are expected to ramp towards 45%.
4. **EPS modeling**: $2 in EPS seems achievable for AMD by fiscal 2025, implying a reasonable price target of $40.
5. **Correction ahead**: The shares will likely hit resistance around $30 and drop back toward $25 over the next several months.

Recommendation:

* Be cautious on AMD stock due to its high valuation.
* Expect a correction in the short term, with prices potentially dropping from $30 to $25.
* Long-term growth fundamentals are still favorable, but the market may need time to recognize this and revalue the stock.
