It appears that there are two separate articles:

**Article 1: Lyft's Revenue Growth**

The article discusses Lyft's revenue growth and its impact on the company's stock price. It highlights that Lyft's revenue has been increasing steadily, with a significant jump in Q4 2018. However, one interesting metric that hasn't shown exponential growth is rides per active rider. The article suggests that this metric could be an important indicator of Lyft's long-term potential and its ability to increase its market share.

**Article 2: NVIDIA and American College of Radiology AI-LAB**

The second article announces a collaboration between NVIDIA and the American College of Radiology (ACR) to accelerate the adoption of AI in diagnostic radiology across thousands of hospitals. The ACR has integrated NVIDIA's Clara AI toolkit into its ACR Data Science Institute, which will be made available to over 38,000 ACR members and other radiology professionals. This platform aims to enable radiologists to build, share, locally adapt, and validate AI algorithms while ensuring patient data remains protected.

There is no apparent connection between the two articles, as they appear to be discussing unrelated topics in the tech and healthcare industries.
