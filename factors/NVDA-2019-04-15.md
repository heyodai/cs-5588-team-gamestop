Based on the provided news articles, here are the top 5 factors that may affect the stock price of NVDA:

1. **NVIDIA's Latest GPU Strategy**: The company's decision to upgrade its older GPUs with a feature previously reserved for newer cards could boost sales and potentially lead to increased demand, positively impacting the stock price.

2. **Data Center Growth**: NVIDIA's strong data center growth has been a key driver of its success in recent years. As the demand for computing accelerators continues to grow, NVDA is well-positioned to benefit from this trend, which could support its stock price.

3. **Global Economy and China's Role**: The news that China is no longer seen as the biggest concern for global markets may have a positive impact on NVIDIA's stock price, as the company has significant exposure to the Chinese market through its business in China and other Asian countries.

4. **Competition from Other Accelerator Companies**: NVIDIA faces competition from other accelerator companies like Xilinx (XLNX) and Intel's (INTC) accelerators. If NVDA is unable to maintain its competitive edge, it could negatively impact its stock price.

5. **Market Sentiment and Investor Expectations**: The news articles mention that investors are split between bulls and bears, with some expecting the market to head to new highs and others being more cautious. Positive sentiment towards NVIDIA's data center growth and GPU strategy could support its stock price, while a negative shift in investor expectations or concerns about competition could negatively impact it.

Note: These factors may not be exhaustive, and other news articles or sources may provide additional insights that could affect NVDA's stock price.
