Based on the provided news, here are the top 5 factors that may affect the stock price of NVDA:

1. **NVIDIA's Go-to-Market Strategy**: The company's ability to successfully launch and market its products can significantly impact its stock price. A strong go-to-market strategy can drive sales and revenue growth, while a weak one can lead to decreased investor confidence.

2. **Data Center Revenue Growth**: NVIDIA's data center business has been growing rapidly, driven by increasing demand for high-performance computing (HPC) and artificial intelligence (AI) applications. This growth is expected to continue, supporting the stock price.

3. **Ray Tracing Technology**: The recent addition of ray tracing technology to some older Pascal GPUs may seem counterintuitive, but it could potentially boost sales. Ray tracing is a highly sought-after feature in gaming and graphics applications, which could lead to increased demand for NVIDIA's products.

4. **Competition from AMD**: The introduction of AMD's latest Ryzen Embedded SoC has raised concerns about competition in the market. While AMD's new products offer high performance required in high-quality graphics and complex edge computing processes, NVIDIA still maintains a strong position due to its more advanced technology and ecosystem.

5. **Global Economic Trends**: J.P. Morgan's warning that Asian equity markets could deliver modest returns for the rest of the year may impact investor sentiment towards NVDA. However, it is essential to note that this factor is more related to market sentiment than fundamental company performance.
