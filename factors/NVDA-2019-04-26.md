The article discusses Intel's first-quarter earnings report, which showed a slowdown in equipment spending by cloud computing companies and headwinds from China. As a result, Intel cut its 2019 revenue guidance, leading to a significant drop in stock price. The article also mentions that the semiconductor sector is under fire from experts in the media, with TSMC and Texas Instruments reporting YoY revenue falls after 11 quarters of growth.

The author notes that while the short-term pain is unavoidable, Intel's long-term efforts in autonomous driving, particularly through its Mobileye subsidiary, could be a positive factor for the stock in the long term. The article also compares two semiconductor stocks, STMicroelectronics (STM) and Nvidia (NVDA), to determine which one is more attractive to value investors.
