Here are the top 5 factors that may affect the stock price of NVDA:

1. **Nvidia's lead over AMD in mid-market and high-end GPU space**: NVDA's comfortable lead in this area is troubling for AMD shareholders, who rely on the CPU market for the company's revenue growth.
2. **AMD's inability to clear inventory levels before releasing Navi GPUs**: Both AMD and Nvidia need to clear inventory levels before it may promote better products at a higher average selling price, which could impact NVDA's stock price.
3. **Navi GPU pricing**: If Navi gets priced at $250, it could accelerate market share growth for AMD, especially in the gaming notebook segment, but this is unlikely given historical trends of AMD releasing competing GPUs that undercuts Nvidia's pricing.
4. **AMD's dependence on console chip sales for revenue**: The company needs a notebook Navi GPU solution to diversify its revenue streams, which could impact NVDA's stock price if it fails to deliver.
5. **Nvidia's valuation compared to AMD**: NVDA trades at a forward P/E ratio of 26X, while AMD trades at a forward P/E ratio of 29X, which may make investors question the value of both stocks and potentially lead to selling pressure on NVDA.
