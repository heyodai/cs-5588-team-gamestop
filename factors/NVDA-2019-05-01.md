Based on the article, here are three reasons to consider buying Nvidia (NVDA) stock:

1. **Improve Technical Situation**: NVDA's stock has shown an improvement in its technical situation after a tough Q4. The 50-day moving average is still supporting the stock, and if it holds above this level, the $190-$192 resistance zone could come into play.
2. **Strong Businesses**: Nvidia's large customer base across various industries makes it a global leader in chip-making. Its products are well-suited for applications such as autonomous driving, datacenter, artificial intelligence, and robotics, which are growing markets with high returns.
3. **Catalyst Potential**: Autonomous driving may not be the best reason to buy NVDA stock today, but it could be a catalyst down the road. As other automakers try to catch up with Tesla's self-driving technology, they will likely look for reliable suppliers of chips, making Nvidia a likely source.

Overall, while there are risks associated with Nvidia's business, such as the potential for datacenter inventory gluts or slowing cloud growth, its strong businesses and diverse customer base position it well for long-term success.
