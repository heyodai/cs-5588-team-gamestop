Based on the article, here are some key points about Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) stock:

1. **Short interest**: 11.2% of AMD's shares are shorted, which is not a high enough level to trigger a massive short-squeeze rally.
2. **Technical charts**: The stock's technical indicators have become somewhat "overbought" in recent weeks, but the recent decline in price has helped to stabilize it.
3. **Short-term outlook**: The author expects AMD stock price to continue declining towards $25-$26 or even $22-$23 in the coming weeks.
4. **Buy signal**: If the price reaches $25 or less, the author would consider buying AMD stock.
5. **Stop-loss strategy**: For existing owners, a stop-loss at 3%-5% below the current price point could protect profits made so far.
6. **Options strategy**: Using a covered call strategy with approximately a two-month time horizon could provide downside protection while generating income.

Overall, the author suggests that investors should be cautious of AMD stock in the short term due to the ongoing trade war and its impact on the technology sector. However, they also expect the stock to rebound in the long term, with a price target of $31-$32 by the end of 2020.
