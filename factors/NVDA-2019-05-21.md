Based on the news articles provided, here are the top 5 factors that may affect the stock price of NVDA (NVIDIA Corporation):

1. **US-China Trade Tensions**: The ongoing economic war between the US and China has been causing a ruckus in the indices' prices, making it difficult for investors to predict the future outlook of various stocks.
2. **Trump's Huawei Ban**: Donald Trump's ban on Chinese telecom giant Huawei has had a significant impact on US chip stocks, as Huawei is a major customer of prominent US companies. This move may have a ripple effect on other tech stocks, including NVIDIA.
3. **Uncertainty about this year's outlook**: Analysts have lowered their expectations for NVIDIA to a GAAP EPS of $0.60, which is lower than the previous year's earnings of $1.88. This uncertainty may affect investor sentiment and lead to a decline in NVDA's stock price.
4. **Rising Inventories Due to China Threat**: Analysts at Morgan Stanley believe that a re-acceleration of semiconductor shipments in the second half of the year is unlikely due to rising inventories. This could lead to a decrease in demand for semiconductors and negatively impact NVIDIA's stock price.
5. **Trade War Impact on Semiconductors**: The ongoing trade war between the US and China may have a significant impact on the semiconductor sector, which could affect NVIDIA's stock price. As mentioned earlier, the trade war has been causing uncertainty in the market, making it difficult for investors to predict the future outlook of various stocks.

Note that these factors may not be exhaustive, and there may be other factors that can influence NVDA's stock price.
