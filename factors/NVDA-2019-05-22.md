The article discusses the current state of Nvidia's stock and its potential for investment opportunities. The key points mentioned are:

1. **Volatility**: Despite the ongoing trade war and tariff tantrums with China, Nvidia's stock is likely to remain volatile in the near term. However, this volatility also provides opportunity.
2. **Earnings Report**: Nvidia reported earnings on May 16 that were a small beat on both the top and bottom line. The company's CFO stated that visibility remains low due to the ongoing U.S/China issues, which led to a sell-off in shares.
3. **Fundamental Analysis**: NVDA stock is attractive from a fundamental view given its better earnings and lower stock price. The current P/E ratio is below 30 and at a discount to the 5-year average of 34.
4. **Technical Analysis**: Nvidia's stock has improved over the past few days, with a recent bounce above $130 providing major downside support.
5. **Option Trading**: The author suggests selling an out-of-the-money bull put spread for a net credit of $0.75 to gain a 17.65% return on risk and a 11% downside cushion.

Overall, the article concludes that Nvidia's stock is a buy opportunity when the chips are down, with the potential for long-term growth and a lower price point.
