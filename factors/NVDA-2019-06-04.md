Based on the provided information, here's a summary of the article and its implications for AMD stock:

**Summary:** The Samsung deal will bring AMD technology into Samsung phones, taking the company's competition with Nvidia in graphics cards to a new level. This deal represents a massive turnaround for AMD, which had traded below $2 per share as recently as 2015. Despite the current high price of around $29 per share, analysts expect profit growth and lower valuations in the near future.

**Implications:**

1. **Earnings growth:** The Samsung deal is expected to bring significant earnings growth for AMD, with forecasted profits of $1 per share for 2020 and expected increases in subsequent years.
2. **Lower valuation:** Despite a currently elevated PE ratio, the current price places the 2020 forward PE ratio at around 28, which is lower than previously estimated levels.
3. **Increased market share:** AMD's recent wins in graphics cards and data centers are expected to increase its market share, driving up stock prices.
4. **Competition with Intel:** The ongoing rivalry between AMD and Intel in the PC era may lead to further innovation and growth opportunities for AMD.

**Risks:**

1. **Market downturn:** An unexpected downturn in the market or tariff-related risks could cause a drop in AMD's stock price, similar to what happened to NVDA last fall.
2. **Memory prices:** The plunge in memory prices could negatively impact chip stocks, including AMD.

**Conclusion:** Based on the analysis, it appears that AMD stock has strong potential to reach new multi-year highs due to its growing earnings, lower valuation, and increased market share. However, investors should be aware of the risks associated with market downturns and the potential impact of memory prices on the chip industry.
