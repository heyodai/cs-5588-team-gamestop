The article discusses how Morgan Stanley's upgrade of Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) stock to "equal weight" had a significant impact on the company's stock price. The upgrade came after Morgan Stanley's analysts reversed their bearish stance on AMD, citing positive near-term catalysts such as the continued success of Ryzen computer processors and the strong popularity of Radeon GPUs.

The article highlights that the market reacted positively to the upgrade, with AMD's stock price surging by 7.86% on the day of the announcement, reaching $31.82. The surge was followed by a nearly 2% gain on Friday.

Morgan Stanley's analysts had previously downgraded AMD to "underweight" in October 2017, leading to a significant decline in the company's stock price. However, they have now raised their target price for AMD stock from $17 to $28 and upgraded it to "equal weight".

The article notes that AMD has been impacted by negative trends such as the collapse of the cryptocurrency mining industry and declining sales of video-game consoles. However, these trends have also affected its competitors, Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA), which is now feeling the sting of the crypto mining collapse.

The article concludes that while Morgan Stanley still has concerns about AMD, the upgrade suggests that the market believes in the company's future prospects. With a high P/E ratio and a lot of runway before hitting its all-time high, AMD stock price may continue to surge.
