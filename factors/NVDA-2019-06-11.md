To answer your question, I'll provide some analysis based on the information provided.

The article discusses Micron Technology (MU) stock, which is experiencing volatile memory-chip pricing dynamics. The company's recent decline in fortunes can be attributed to a combination of factors, including:

1. **Trade war with China**: The U.S. Department of Commerce labeled Micron as a national security threat due to concerns over Chinese espionage.
2. **Volatile memory-chip pricing dynamics**: The semiconductor industry is experiencing a supply glut, leading to decreased demand and prices for memory chips.

However, the article also presents an optimistic view on Micron's long-term prospects. The author argues that:

1. **The trade war will ultimately benefit Micron**: Trump's actions against China may have hurt Micron in the short term, but they will also help the company by reducing the threat of Chinese espionage and intellectual theft.
2. **Demand for semiconductors will increase**: While the current market is experiencing a supply glut, the author believes that demand for semiconductors will eventually pick up as data centers and other related industries continue to grow.

Based on this analysis, it appears that Micron's stock price may face short-term volatility due to the trade war and supply glut, but the company's long-term prospects are promising. As a result, the author suggests that investors should consider buying shares of MU on discount if the stock prices takes the predicted tumble.
