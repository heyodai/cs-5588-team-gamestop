Based on the news articles provided, here are the top 5 factors that may affect the stock price of NVDA (NVIDIA):

1. **Growth in the datacenter segment**: NVIDIA's growth in the datacenter segment is a significant factor that can impact its stock price. The company's DGX SuperPOD supercomputer, which consists of 96 Nvidia DGX-2H supercomputers, is expected to be one of the world's top-performing supercomputers.

2. **Partnerships and collaborations**: NVIDIA's partnerships with Arm, Mellanox Technologies, and other companies can impact its stock price. The company's support for Arm CPUs and its ability to work with these companies' chips can lead to new business opportunities and growth.

3. **Immigration issues affecting the US tech industry**: Immigration is a critical driver of the US tech industry, and any issues that affect this can have an impact on NVIDIA's stock price. The company relies heavily on immigrant workers to support its operations and contribute to its innovation.

4. **Competition from AMD**: AMD has been making significant strides in the semiconductor market, particularly in the server CPU segment. If AMD is able to gain traction and share gains from Intel, it could negatively impact NVIDIA's stock price.
