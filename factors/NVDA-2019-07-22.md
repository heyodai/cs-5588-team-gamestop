This article discusses the potential impact of the US Department of Justice's decision on Qualcomm's stock price. The DOJ has argued that Judge Lucy Koh's decision to block Qualcomm's "no license, no chips" policy could put national security at risk by undermining US leadership in 5G technology and standard-setting.

The author notes that while this argument may be based on facts, it is also a form of protectionism, and the DOJ's letter is more political than legal. The article also mentions that Qualcomm has reached an interim patent licensing deal with Huawei, which could potentially put pressure on Qualcomm's business practices.

The author concludes that despite these risks, Qualcomm's stock price may be driven up by the perception of national security concerns. He notes that Qualcomm's dividend yield is 3.33%, which is higher than what you get on a 30-year bond, and that the company has a strong chance of winning a big share of the 5G modem marketplace if it adjusts its business practices.

Overall, the article suggests that while there are risks associated with Qualcomm's stock price, the potential benefits of being seen as a champion of national security could drive up the stock price.
