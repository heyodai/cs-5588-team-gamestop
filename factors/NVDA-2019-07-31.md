According to the article, the author is bullish on Nvidia (NVDA) stock and expects it to reach $5 and potentially scale the $200 barrier. Here are some key points from the article:

1. **Nvidia's strong position in multiple tech sub-niches**: The company is a leader in graphics processing units for video games and competes with AMD in serving the hashpower-heavy requirements of bitcoin miners.
2. **Monopoly in cloud platforms**: Nvidia owns 97.4% of market share compared to AMD's 1%, according to Liftr Cloud Insights.
3. **Recovery from "crypto hangover"**: The author expects a rebound in the second half based on a potential recovery of the entire chipmaker sector, which could benefit NVDA.
4. **U.S.-China trade war**: The ongoing trade tensions could drag on for a while, but the author believes there's plenty of time left in the year for a resolution, which could breathe life into tech stocks like Nvidia.
5. **Earnings expectations**: Analysts expect revenues to decline by 7% to $10.90 billion and earnings per share to decline by 20% to $5.30 in fiscal year 2020. The author is optimistic that these expectations will be wrong and that NVDA stock will surprise investors with a pleasant earnings report.
6. **Investor psychology**: Breaking the $200 barrier will attract new buyers and take NVDA stock to $250 and beyond, according to the author.
