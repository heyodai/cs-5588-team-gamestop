The article discusses the current state of AMD's (Advanced Micro Devices) stock, particularly in light of the ongoing trade tensions between the US and China. The author notes that AMD needs China to complete and sustain its recovery track, but a significant drop in China-based sales could impact total revenues. Additionally, the author suggests that AMD's competitors, including Nvidia and Intel, have a resource advantage, making it harder for AMD to compete.

The article also mentions a rumor about Dr. Lisa Su, the CEO of AMD, potentially leaving her position to join IBM, citing that this would be a significant departure for AMD and could lead to a loss in value for the stock. However, if Su were to leave AMD and join IBM, it would likely be seen as a positive move for both Su and IBM.

In terms of specific recommendations, the author suggests trimming a position with AMD stock due to the potential risks associated with the trade tensions and the lack of upside potential for Su's leadership in AMD. They also highlight other stocks that are currently experiencing volatility, such as those in the internet sector.
