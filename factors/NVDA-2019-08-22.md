The article discusses the latest earnings report from Nvidia (NVDA) and its implications for the company's stock price. Here are the key points:

1. **Strong earnings beat**: NVDA beat both earnings and revenues estimates, with revenue growing 27% year-over-year and earnings increasing by $0.09 per share.
2. **Gaming revenue up, but still down from last year**: Gaming revenue grew to over $1.3 billion, a 24% increase from the previous quarter of 2019, but still 27% lower than last year's same period.
3. **Data center revenue weak**: Data center revenue rose only 3% sequentially and is still down double digits from last year.
4. **Lower guidance**: NVDA posted lower-than-expected guidance, indicating that the company expects weaker growth in the future.
5. **Trade war concerns**: The trade war continues to impact Nvidia's sales, with many semiconductor companies reporting weak demand due to tariffs.
6. **Stock price implications**: The stock price is still trading at more than 8x sales, which is relatively high for a semiconductor company, and shares are likely to be affected by the weaker-than-expected guidance.

Overall, while the earnings report was positive on some fronts, such as gaming revenue, it also highlighted areas of weakness in data center sales and lower-than-expected guidance. The trade war continues to pose a risk to Nvidia's sales, and investors may want to take this into account when making decisions about the stock price.

**Buy or sell?**

Based on the article, I would not recommend buying NVDA stock at this time. While the earnings report was positive on some fronts, the weaker-than-expected guidance and ongoing trade war concerns suggest that growth prospects may be limited. The stock price is also trading at a relatively high valuation, which may make it vulnerable to downward pressure if expectations are not met.

**Price target**

Based on the article, I would estimate a price target of around $90-$100 per share, assuming that shares will trade at more than 5x sales.

**Recommendation**

I would recommend avoiding NVDA stock until there is stronger guidance and evidence of growth beyond gaming revenue. The ongoing trade war and data center weakness suggest that the company's sales are still vulnerable to external factors, and investors may want to wait for a more positive outlook before buying into the stock.
