The article discusses the current valuation of Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) stock and raises concerns that it may be overvalued. While AMD has had a remarkable turnaround under CEO Lisa Su, including driving the stock price from under $2 to over $30, the analyst consensus target of $33.18 is only 5% better than the current stock price.

The article notes that the bulk of AMD's growth is already priced in and that investors are basing their valuations on past performance rather than future prospects. This is a classic warning sign of an overvalued stock, as it suggests that investors are expecting too much from the company going forward.

The author also points out that other tech stocks, such as NVIDIA (NVDA) and Intel (INTC), have lower valuation multiples, making AMD's valuation stand out even more. The article concludes that investors should be cautious when considering AMD stock and consider whether it is truly undervalued or if the market has already priced in all of its growth potential.

Key points to take away:

* AMD's turnaround under CEO Lisa Su has been remarkable, but the analyst consensus target of $33.18 may not reflect a sustainable valuation.

* Other tech stocks, such as NVIDIA and Intel, have lower valuation multiples, making AMD's valuation stand out even more.
* Investors should be cautious when considering AMD stock and consider whether it is truly undervalued or if the market has already priced in all of its growth potential.

Trading tips:
