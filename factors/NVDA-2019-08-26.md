The article discusses the volatility in Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) stock price in August, which has been driven by several key factors. These include:

1. Q2 earnings report: AMD reported revenue of $1.53 billion, down 13% year-over-year, and issued revised full-year guidance, warning of lower-than-expected revenue from its semi-custom chips.
2. CEO departure rumors: There were rumors that AMD CEO Dr. Lisa Su might leave the company for IBM, which shook investor confidence in AMD stock.
3. Launch of new EPYC Rome processors: AMD launched powerful new servers aimed at the data center market, which drove AMD stock up 16% on the news.
4. New Intel chips: Intel announced a new series of 10th generation "Comet Lake" processors that will take on AMD's mobile Ryzen chips for laptops starting this fall.
5. Trade war with China: The ongoing trade war with China has added additional volatility to AMD stock, with President Donald Trump announcing new tariffs on $300 billion worth of Chinese products.

Despite the volatility, AMD stock has recovered steadily in 2019 and is up nearly 70% since the start of the year. However, the question remains whether Advanced Micro Devices still has upside after hitting five-year highs earlier this month.
