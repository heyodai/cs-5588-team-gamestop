Here are the top 5 factors that may affect the stock price of NVDA, as extracted from the news:

1. **Trade War**: The ongoing trade war between the US and China has put Nvidia's comeback bid on hold, dampening business confidence and certainty, and reducing spending on its chips.
2. **Cyclical Semiconductor Industry**: The semiconductor industry is notoriously cyclical, and currently, it's in a downturn. This has led to weakening demand, high inventory levels, and a decline in revenues, margins, and profits for Nvidia.
3. **Uncertainty on Trade War Front**: Until the trade war gets resolved, Nvidia stock won't make much progress on its comeback bid. The uncertainty will continue to weigh on the company's stock price.
4. **Nvidia's Q2 Results**: While Nvidia's Q2 results showed improving fundamentals, the company's guidance calls for declines in revenues, margins, and profits to moderate in Q3. This may indicate that Nvidia is gradually clawing its way out of the downturn.
5. **Long-Term Growth Potential**: Despite the short-term challenges, Nvidia has enormous long-term growth potential due to its dominance in AI and data markets. As demand for these technologies continues to grow, Nvidia's stock price is likely to appreciate in the long run.

These factors suggest that NVDA's stock price may experience near-term volatility until the trade war is resolved and the cyclical semiconductor industry recovers. However, with its strong long-term growth potential, Nvidia remains a promising investment opportunity.
