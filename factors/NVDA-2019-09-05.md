Based on the analysis provided:

1. The trade war between the US and China is expected to cool down in the next 12-16 months, with both sides having an incentive to put the tensions on hold after the 2020 election and once China's economy stabilizes.

2. AMD stock is expected to benefit from this development, as the company's market share expansion narrative remains robust.

3. The market share expansion narrative is still driven by AMD's ability to rapidly gain share in the CPU and GPU markets, with the recent launch of EPYC in the cloud market and Ryzen 3000 CPUs being significant contributors.

4. The fundamentals also support this outlook, with China's economy slowing down and the US heading into an election year where trade tensions could dampen the economy and markets.

5. Therefore, AMD stock is expected to grind higher in the long term, despite near-term trade war weakness.

6. In contrast, chip stocks have been in turmoil recently due to trade conflicts and slowing economic growth, with the Philadelphia Semiconductor Index (SOX) plummeting by 13.1% from its recent high on July 25, 2019.

Overall, AMD stock is expected to benefit from the expected cooling down of trade tensions between the US and China, while chip stocks face challenges due to ongoing trade conflicts and economic growth concerns.
