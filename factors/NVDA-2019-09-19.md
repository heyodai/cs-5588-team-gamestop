Here are the top 5 factors that may affect the stock price of NVDA (Nvidia) based on the news:

1. **Growing Demand for 5G-Enabled Chips**: As telecom providers switch from 4G to 5G, chip makers will see a resurgence in business, with every device requiring 5G-compatible chips. This is expected to drive growth and increase demand for NVDA's GPUs, leading to an upward pressure on its stock price.
2. **Increasing Use of GPUs Across Diverse Markets**: Analysts such as Ruben Roy (Benchmark) believe that NVDA is positioned for faster growth relative to semiconductor peers due to the increasing use of GPUs across a diverse set of markets. This suggests that NVDA's stock price may benefit from this trend.
3. **Steady Profitability and Growth**: Analysts like Timothy Arcuri (UBS) expect NVDA to show steady profitability going forward, with revenue growth driven by annual unit growth. This positive outlook on the company's financial performance is likely to support its stock price.
4. **Positive Earnings and Revenue Forecasts**: NVDA has reported increasing EPS for three consecutive quarters, with forecasts indicating an expected $1.24 per share in earnings for November 2019. Strong earnings and revenue growth are typically associated with an upward pressure on a company's stock price.
5. **Analyst Consensus and Price Target**: The analyst consensus on NVDA is a Moderate Buy, derived from 20 buys, 5 holds, and 2 sells set by top analysts in the last three months. The average price target of $187 suggests an upside potential of 4.4% from the current share price of $179.
