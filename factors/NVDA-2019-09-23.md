Here are the top 5 factors that may affect the stock price of NVDA (NVIDIA) based on the news article:

1. **Improving demand trends**: Analyst William Stein at SunTrust Robinson Humphrey cited evidence of constructive demand trends in all end markets, including gaming, pro-viz, automotive, and datacenter, as a reason to raise his price target.
2. **Improved profitability expectations**: Stein's new price target suggests that he expects improving profitability for the company, which could lead to increased investor confidence and upward pressure on the stock price.
3. **Competition from AMD and Intel**: The article mentions that both AMD and Intel are now willing to compete with NVIDIA in terms of performance and price, which could lead to a decrease in demand for NVIDIA's products if they cannot maintain their market share.
4. **Trade war risks**: As 30% of AMD's business is dependent on China, any escalation of the trade war could significantly impact AMD's business and stock price.
5. **Valuation concerns**: The article highlights that NVDA's valuation multiples are high compared to other GPU stocks, which could lead to a decrease in investor confidence if the company fails to meet expectations and justify its high valuations.

These factors may contribute to volatility in the stock price of NVDA, but it's essential to conduct thorough research and analysis before making any investment decisions.
