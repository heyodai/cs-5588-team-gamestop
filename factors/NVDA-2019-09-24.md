The article discusses the challenges facing Intel stock, particularly in light of AMD's growing market share and the potential for datacenter demand to recover. The author argues that while Intel may still grow revenue and profits even if it loses market share, its dominance in the chip market makes share losses less impactful than they would be for AMD.

However, the article also notes that any investor arguing for Intel stock on the basis of overall chip demand growth should consider looking elsewhere, as Intel's end markets are more likely to benefit rivals. The author suggests that investors might consider buying Intel stock at a lower price, particularly if they're looking for a dividend yield or downside protection.

Some potential reasons to buy Intel stock include:

* It is cheaper than rival stocks, with an 11x forward P/E multiple
* It offers downside protection in the event of a chip downturn
* The dividend yield is attractive at 2.5%
* Intel may have less risk than some of its peers due to its diversified product portfolio

However, the article also notes that buying a stock for a dividend alone can be a dangerous proposition, and investors should consider other factors beyond just dividend yield.

Ultimately, the author concludes that while Intel stock may hold up well in certain scenarios, it is not an ideal choice for investors looking to bet on chip growth driven by specific end markets. Instead, they suggest considering other stocks or sectors that offer more exposure to these areas, such as equipment suppliers Lam Research and Applied Materials.
