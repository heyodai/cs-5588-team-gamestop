Based on the provided news articles, here are the top 5 factors that may affect the stock price of NVDA (Nvidia):

1. **Golden Sachs' Price Target Increase**: On Wednesday, Goldman Sachs analysts lifted their price target for NVDA from $179 to $192, citing strong fiscal-third-quarter results from the gaming business, which could boost investor confidence and drive up the stock price.

2. **Reclaiming the 20-day Moving Average**: As NVDA shares reclaim the 20-day moving average, traders are shifting their outlook higher in the short term, suggesting a potential upward trend in the stock price.

3. **50% Retracement Support and Resistance**: The $172.50 level serves as support on the downside, while above it puts the high at $188.40 on the table, which comes into play near the 61.8% retracement. This indicates that NVDA's price may bounce back from this level if it falls below $172.50.

4. **Chips Sector Bounce and Trading Activity**: The semiconductor sector bounced slightly due to a rally in the broader stock market, with shares of Micron Technology Inc., KLA Corp., and Qualcomm Inc. gaining ground. This could contribute to an overall positive sentiment for NVDA's stock price, especially if other chip stocks also perform well.

5. **Nvidia's Strong Gaming Business**: The article mentions that Goldman analyst Toshiya Hari sees strong fiscal-third-quarter results from Nvidia's gaming business, which eases inventory within channels and launches new products. This could lead to increased investor confidence in NVDA's stock price, especially if the company delivers strong earnings reports.

These factors collectively suggest that NVDA's stock price may experience an upward trend due to improved analyst expectations, rebounding chip stocks, and a strong gaming business.
