Based on the news articles, here are the top 5 factors that may affect the stock price of NVDA (NVIDIA):

1. **ISM services index missed expectations**: A weak ISM services index can indicate a slowdown in economic growth, which may negatively impact NVIDIA's stock price as investors become more cautious about the tech industry's prospects.

2. **Software stocks lead Dow Jones recovery**: The strong performance of software stocks, including NVIDIA, suggests that investors are optimistic about the tech sector's future growth prospects. This could support NVDA's stock price.

3. **Self-driving car companies discuss public fears**: The focus on self-driving cars and public safety concerns may indicate a shift in investor sentiment towards more sustainable and responsible technologies, which could positively impact NVIDIA's stock price as it is a leader in AI and autonomous driving solutions.

4. **Bed Bath & Beyond rises on quarterly results**: A strong performance from Bed Bath & Beyond may signal a broader uptrend in consumer spending, which could benefit tech stocks like NVIDIA that rely on consumer demand for their products.

5. **Snap Stock plunges (not directly affecting NVDA)**: The plunge in Snap's stock price may be seen as a sign of caution among investors, but it is not directly related to NVDA's performance. However, the overall market reaction to this event could influence sentiment towards tech stocks, including NVIDIA.
