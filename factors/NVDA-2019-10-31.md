Based on the news articles provided, here are the top 5 factors that may affect the stock price of NVDA (NVIDIA):

1. **Competition from AMD**: NVIDIA's competitor, AMD, has been performing well in recent quarters, and its strong sales of 7nm Ryzen processors, Radeon graphics chips, and EPYC server chips have offset weaknesses in their Enterprise, Embedded, and Semi-Custom business. This increased competition may put pressure on NVIDIA's stock price.
2. **Growing competition in the PC market**: The PC market is experiencing challenges, including a decline in worldwide shipments and soft demand for game consoles. If this trend continues, it could negatively impact NVIDIA's sales of gaming GPUs and other PC-related products.
3. **Impact of Microsoft's Windows 7 support phase-out**: Microsoft's decision to phase out support for Windows 7 has given the moribund PC market a boost, which is good news for AMD and its rivals. This could lead to increased demand for AMD's Computing and Graphics division, but it may also have a negative impact on NVIDIA's stock price if they are unable to keep up with the competition.
4. **Soft demand for game consoles**: Soft demand for game consoles from Microsoft (Xbox) and Sony (PlayStation) has resulted in a decline in revenue for AMD's Enterprise, Embedded, and Semi-Custom business. If this trend continues, it could negatively impact NVIDIA's sales of gaming GPUs and other PC-related products.
5. **Valuation concerns**: NVIDIA trades at a premium valuation multiple compared to its rivals, including Intel (13.1), AMD (179), and Texas Instruments (21.9). This high valuation may make investors cautious about buying the stock, especially if the company's earnings growth is not meeting expectations.
