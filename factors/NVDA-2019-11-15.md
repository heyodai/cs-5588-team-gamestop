Based on the provided article, it seems that Nvidia Corp has completed its escape from the crypto hangover and is now facing a rebound question. The company's Q3 2020 earnings report was positive, with strong data center revenue and a cheap valuation. However, investors underreacted to the news, causing shares to waver after-hours on Thursday and remain flat on Friday in pre-market trading.

Despite this, analysts are optimistic about Nvidia's future prospects, citing a beat on both earnings and revenue expectations. The company expects strong data center revenue, which is seen as an area of focus for investors. Additionally, data center revenue estimates are turning positive, carrying higher margins, which has led analysts to hike their price targets.

The article also mentions that the US stock indexes hit record highs on Friday following bullish comments on US-China trade talks from a key White House adviser, which could have a positive impact on tech stocks like Nvidia.

Overall, it seems that Nvidia is poised for a rebound, and investors should consider buying the dip in the stock. However, it's essential to keep an eye on the company's near-term revenue forecast, which was softer than expected, and how it will affect the overall outlook.
