Based on the news articles, here are the top 5 factors that may affect the stock price of NVDA (Nvidia):

1. **Trade tensions and uncertainty**: The ongoing trade war between the US and China has been a significant headwind for many chipmakers, including NVDA. However, as rhetoric between Washington and Beijing continues to improve, investors have started to return to NVDA stock.
2. **Gaming industry growth**: NVDA's gaming arm is expected to see strong demand in 2020, driven by the Nintendo Switch and Switch Lite console sales, which are likely to boost its revenue and profitability.
3. **Data center business performance**: While NVDA's data center revenue was down 8% from the year-ago quarter in Q3, it was still up 11% from the previous quarter, indicating a positive trend. The company's GPU business is expected to remain competitive with AMD.
4. **Valuation and risk**: NVDA stock has a high valuation, which makes it a risky bet if it doesn't live up to expectations. Investors may be concerned about the company's ability to maintain its growth momentum in the face of increasing competition and uncertainty.
5. **Future growth opportunities**: NVDA has growth opportunities in other fast-growing tech spaces, such as artificial intelligence and autonomous driving. The company's competitive position in these areas is likely to drive future growth and attract investors.

These factors are expected to impact NVDA's stock price, but it's essential to note that the stock market can be volatile, and actual performance may differ from expectations.
