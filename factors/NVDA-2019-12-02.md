Based on the news, here are the top 5 factors that may affect the stock price of NVDA (NVIDIA):

1. **Rally above $42**: A move above this level could lead to a target of $50 or more, as predicted by RBC Capital Market and Rosenblatt.
2. **Support at $34.30-$35.50**: If AMD's stock declines to this area and finds support again, it could be a sign that buyers are stepping back in and potentially driving the price up.
3. **Improving company fundamentals**: Strong revenue growth, shrinking debt, and product enhancements are all contributing to a healthier business environment, which could support NVDA's stock price.
4. **Comparison with AMD**: The comparison between NVDA and AMD is an interesting one, as both companies have been impacted by the crypto collapse and are expected to recover in the coming years.
5. **Global trends in mobility**: The 2020 Olympics in Japan are likely to showcase new developments in autonomous driving technology, which could benefit both NVIDIA and AMD as they continue to develop their respective products.

Note that these factors may not necessarily affect NVDA's stock price independently, but rather interact with each other in complex ways to influence the market.
