Based on the provided news articles, here are the top 5 factors that may affect the stock price of TSLA (Tesla Inc):

1. **Government incentives for electric car sales**: The decision by many countries to further incentivize electric car sales could lead to a significant increase in demand for Tesla's products, potentially boosting its stock price.
2. **Competition and market share**: As the automotive industry shifts towards electric vehicles, competition among companies will intensify. TSLA may need to form alliances or invest heavily in research and development to stay ahead of competitors.
3. **Diversification and expansion into new areas**: Tesla's reliance on Model 3 sales is a concern. The company may need to diversify its product lineup and explore new markets, such as autonomous driving technology, to drive growth and maintain investor confidence.
4. **Global demand for electric cars**: Rising global demand for electric cars could lead to increased sales and revenue for TSLA, but it also depends on the company's ability to adapt to changing market conditions and maintain its competitive edge.
5. **Competition from other companies in emerging technologies**: The growth of self-driving car technology may benefit companies like Alphabet (GOOG) more than TSLA, depending on their investment strategies and technological advancements.

Note that these factors are not mutually exclusive, and the impact of one factor can be influenced by others.
