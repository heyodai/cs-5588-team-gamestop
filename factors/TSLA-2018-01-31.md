Based on the provided news articles, here are the top 5 factors that may affect the stock price of TSLA (Tesla Inc.):

1. **Reduced expectations for production of mass-market Model 3**: Tesla's announcement that it won't hit last year's goal of 5,000 vehicles per week until the second quarter of this year may lead to concerns about the company's ability to meet demand and ramp up production.
2. **Acquisition by Cummins**: The acquisition of a vehicle battery systems business from Johnson Matthey by Cummins, a truck engine giant, may impact Tesla's market share in the electric vehicle (EV) industry, particularly if Cummins can offer more competitive pricing or technology.
3. **Increasing competition from other EV manufacturers**: As mentioned in the article "Want the Scoop on Tesla’s Model 3? That Will Cost You $500,000", a shortage of Model 3 sedans has created a frenzy among competitors, Tesla enthusiasts, and auto reviewers to get their hands on the electric car. This increased competition may put pressure on Tesla's stock price.
4. **Investor sentiment**: The article "Tesla Earnings: With Bar Lowered, Time to Make the Leap" mentions that investors haven't been in a buying mood recently as Tesla's shares have gained less than half as much as the S&P 500 during the past three months. If investor sentiment remains negative, it could continue to affect the stock price.
5. **Ramp-up challenges**: As mentioned in the article "Tesla Model 3s bought by firm selling Tesla’s secrets: report", engineering firm's CEO says that 10 auto makers are customers for the information his company gleans from studying Model 3s. This may indicate that there are still challenges in ramping up production and meeting demand, which could impact the stock price.

These factors may contribute to a negative sentiment around Tesla's stock price, but it's essential to note that the stock market is inherently unpredictable, and many other factors can influence the company's performance.
