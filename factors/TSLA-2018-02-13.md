2. **Inflation concerns**: Fund managers' worries about inflation and another bond market crash could negatively impact TSLA's stock price if investors become more cautious about investing in tech stocks.
3. **Analysts' estimates of 1Q18 earnings**: The analysts' consensus estimates suggest that Tesla's quarterly loss could be $2.65 per share in 1Q18, which may disappoint investors and affect the stock price.
4. **Volatility and market sentiment**: The recent volatility in the market, as well as the mixed tone on TSLA's stock release after its Q4 earnings report, may lead to short-term price fluctuations.
5. **Comparison to peers and industry trends**: Tesla's stock price performance is often compared to that of its peers, such as Nvidia and Apple. A strong performance in these areas could boost investor confidence in TSLA, while a decline might negatively impact the stock.
