Based on the provided news articles, here are the top 5 factors that may affect the stock price of TSLA (Tesla):

1. **Model 3 production and deliveries**: Tesla's ability to ramp up Model 3 production and meet demand will have a significant impact on its stock price. The company aims to increase production to help it go from delivering just over 100,000 units in 2017 to more than 500,000 as of July last year.

2. **Elon Musk's compensation package**: Glass Lewis, a proxy firm, opposes Tesla's massive stock award to Musk, which could be seen as a negative for the company's stock price if it is not approved. The award is valued at $2.6 billion and would give Musk 28.3% ownership of the company.

3. **Market sentiment**: The recent decline in Tesla's stock price from around $360 to $300 may indicate market-related risk-off selling, which could be a concern for investors.

4. **Competition from rivals**: The emergence of low-profile Tesla rival SF Motors, which is beginning autonomous-drive road tests in California, may pose a threat to Tesla's dominance in the electric vehicle market and impact its stock price.

5. **Industry trends and outlook**: Tesla's struggles with meeting Model 3 demand and concerns about its ability to ramp up production, as well as broader industry challenges in electric vehicle development, could affect investor confidence and lead to a decline in the company's stock price.
