Tesla shareholders have approved an ambitious pay package for CEO Elon Musk, worth up to $2.6 billion if Tesla delivers on its goals. The plan includes a stock option grant and will guarantee Musk's presence at the company for at least the next decade. However, critics argue that this is excessive compensation for a CEO, especially considering the company's financial struggles. CalSTRS, one of the largest pension funds in California, opposes the package due to concerns about profitability and focus on stock-based compensation.
