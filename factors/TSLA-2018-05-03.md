The text does not provide any information on what bonds do in the secondary market. It appears to be a collection of articles and news stories about Tesla, Elon Musk, and other technology companies, but it does not mention bonds or their role in the secondary market. 

However, I can tell you that bonds are financial instruments that represent debt obligations between two parties: the bond issuer (also known as the borrower) and the bondholder. In the primary market, bonds are issued by companies or governments to raise funds for various purposes. The bond issuer borrows money from the bondholder, promising to repay the principal amount with interest.

In the secondary market, existing bonds can be bought and sold among investors. This market provides liquidity to bondholders, allowing them to quickly sell their bonds if needed. Bond prices in the secondary market are determined by supply and demand forces, similar to other securities markets.
