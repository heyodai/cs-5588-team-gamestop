3. **Musk's behavior during the call**: Musk sparred with Wall Street analysts, taking over a dozen consecutive questions from YouTube investment channel HyperChange TV, which had previously recommended buying Tesla shares.

4. **Industry context**: The article notes that Volkswagen AG's emissions scandal has reached the highest echelons of the company, and Denver Post Editor Chuck Plunkett resigned after criticizing the newspaper's hedge fund owners as "vulture capitalists".

5. **Financials and production goals**: Musk set ambitious financial and operational goals before, only to backtrack or delay later on.

6. **Market trends**: Asian stock markets were lower on Friday due to concerns about trade talks between the US and China.

7. **Tesla's battery technology**: Despite Tesla's efforts to reduce cobalt usage in its batteries, there may still be a coming supply crunch as the auto industry shifts towards electric vehicles.
