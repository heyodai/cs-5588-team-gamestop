Based on the provided news articles, here are the top 5 factors that may affect the stock price of TSLA (Tesla):

1. **Production and Manufacturing Update**: Elon Musk's pledge to produce 5,000 Model 3 sedans per week by the end of the month is under scrutiny, with some experts questioning the feasibility of such a large production target. A successful implementation of this plan could boost confidence in Tesla's manufacturing capabilities and potentially drive up the stock price.
2. **Trade War Rhetoric**: Increased trade tensions between the US and EU could negatively impact Tesla's business, particularly if it leads to tariffs on imported components or disruptions to global supply chains. This could lead to a decline in investor confidence and drive down the stock price.
3. **Services Margins Concerns**: A drop in Tesla's "services and other" margins over the past few quarters has raised concerns among analysts, including Bernstein's Toni Sacconaghi. If this trend continues, it could indicate underlying issues with Tesla's business model and lead to a decline in investor confidence.
4. **Autopilot System Development**: The development of Tesla's Autopilot system, particularly its "Mad Max" lane-changing setting, is expected to be crucial for the company's future growth. Any delays or setbacks in this area could negatively impact the stock price.
5. **Global Economic Uncertainty**: The ongoing border crisis and trade war rhetoric have created an atmosphere of uncertainty, which could affect investor confidence in Tesla and other companies. A decrease in investor sentiment due to these factors could lead to a decline in the stock price.

Note that these factors are not exhaustive, and there may be other events or announcements that can impact TSLA's stock price.
