1. **Increased prices**: The article mentions that Tesla has raised the prices of its Model S and Model X in China by 150,000 yuan to 250,000 yuan due to additional tariffs. This could be a sign of increased demand or higher production costs.
2. **Tariffs**: The imposition of 25% tariffs on US products worth $34 billion, including certain passenger cars, could lead to higher prices for Tesla's vehicles in China and potentially affect the company's sales.
3. **Elon Musk's tweet**: Elon Musk tweeted about a "tiny, kid-size submarine" being used to transport a person across a pool, which could be related to the rescue efforts of the boys trapped in the Thai cave. While this is not directly related to Tesla's stock, it shows Musk's willingness to take on new challenges and potentially impact the company's brand.
