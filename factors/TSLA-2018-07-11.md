Here's the summary:

Tesla has announced plans to build its second car-assembly plant in China, with the facility expected to be located in Shanghai. The company will be building the factory without a local joint venture partner, which is a first for foreign automakers in China.

The Shanghai government welcomed Tesla's move, saying it was a significant investment and would boost sales in the world's largest auto market. The city's Deputy Director of Economy and Information Technology, Huang Ou, said that any sharing of technology with Chinese partners would be "subject to negotiation".

Tesla has raised prices on US-made vehicles sold in China due to new tariffs imposed by the Chinese government.

The move is seen as a significant step for Tesla, which aims to expand its presence in China, the world's largest electric vehicle market. The company's CEO, Elon Musk, was in Shanghai to sign the agreement.

However, the decision also raises concerns about Tesla's strategy and impact on US jobs. As foreign automakers are no longer required to work with local partners, some US-based companies have faced disruptions in sales and supply chains as a result of the trade war.
