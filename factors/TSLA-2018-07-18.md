Elon Musk has apologized for calling a British cave diver "pedo guy" and labeling him as a pedophile. The apology comes after the diver, Vern Unsworth, threatened legal action against Musk over the comment. Unsworth had been involved in the early days of efforts to save the Thai cave rescue mission and had criticized Musk's plan to rescue the trapped boys with a submarine.
