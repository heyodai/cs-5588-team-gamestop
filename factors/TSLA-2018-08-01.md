It appears that the text is not providing news or information on how to raise funds in China for Tesla's factory. However, I can provide some general information on the topic.

Tesla has announced plans to invest $5 billion in building a factory in China, and it is considering raising funds in China to finance at least a portion of this investment. This is part of Tesla's ambitious expansion plan, which includes building a factory in Europe as well.

If you're looking to raise funds in China for your own project or business, here are some general tips:

1. **Understand Chinese regulations**: Familiarize yourself with the laws and regulations governing fundraising in China.
2. **Choose the right funding route**: Consider options such as private equity, venture capital, or debt financing, depending on your company's needs.
3. **Network with potential investors**: Attend industry events, conferences, and networking sessions to connect with potential investors and partners.
4. **Prepare a strong pitch**: Develop a clear and compelling business plan that showcases your project's value proposition and potential for growth.
5. **Consider partnering with Chinese companies**: Collaborating with local businesses or government-backed entities can help facilitate funding and expand your reach.

However, I would like to note that the text does not provide specific information on how to raise funds in China, and it's always best to consult with a financial advisor or expert in Chinese business law before proceeding.
