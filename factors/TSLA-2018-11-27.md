The article discusses Tesla's recent struggles, including a 70% decline in sales in China due to trade tensions with the US. Despite this, Tesla's stock has actually gone up from $310 to $347 per share since early October. The article also mentions that Elon Musk said Tesla was "bleeding money like crazy" earlier this year and that he had secured funding to take Tesla private.

The question is whether Tesla's stock will find another gear amidst the market sell-off. Some points to consider:

* Despite the recent decline in sales, Tesla's stock has still shown a positive trend since early October.
* Elon Musk's statements about Tesla being "near death" and "bleeding cash" earlier this year may have been an attempt to manage investor expectations and prevent a sell-off in the stock.
* The Sino-US trade war is having a significant impact on Tesla's sales in China, but it's not clear how much of a long-term effect this will have on the company's prospects.
* Tesla has been working to improve its production efficiency and reduce costs, which could help to drive growth in the future.

Overall, while there are challenges ahead for Tesla, there are also reasons to be optimistic about the company's prospects. The question is whether investors will see the stock as a good opportunity to buy amidst the market sell-off.
