It appears that Elon Musk has announced on Twitter that Tesla will stop selling the lowest-priced versions of its Model S and X vehicles, which include the 75 kWh battery models with a range of 259 miles for the Model S and 237 miles for the Model X. The prices for these models will be increased to $76,000 for the Model S and $82,000 for the Model X.

This change is expected to take effect on Monday, and it's unclear how this will impact Tesla's sales or customer demand. However, Musk has stated that the company is not phasing out these models in the next two years, suggesting that there may be other options available to customers who want a lower-cost option.

It's worth noting that Tesla has been increasing prices for its vehicles in recent months, and this move appears to be another example of that trend. The company has also been focusing on more expensive models with higher-performance capabilities, which may appeal to some customers but not others.

In other news, Musk announced that a planned upgrade to Tesla's Summon auto-parking feature called Summon+ is undergoing regulatory approval and will "probably" be available for some customers soon. He also mentioned that Tesla's cheapest Model S and X cars are being discontinued, citing the need to increase prices to keep up with production costs.

Overall, it seems that Tesla is making changes to its product lineup and pricing strategy in an effort to stay competitive and profitable, but these moves may not necessarily benefit all of its customers.
