The article discusses several topics related to Elon Musk and Tesla:

1. **SEC Contempt Motion**: The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has filed a contempt motion against Elon Musk, alleging that he brazenly ignored a federal judge's order to ensure his tweets about Tesla were approved by the company's lawyers.
2. **Musk's Defense**: Musk has argued that the order only covers information that is material to investors, but the SEC claims this is not true and that Musk has never sought pre-approval for a single tweet.
3. **Tesla Production Numbers**: One of Musk's tweets boasted that Tesla would build 500,000 electric cars in 2019, which the SEC claims violated an agreement related to securities-fraud charges.
4. **Quarter-End Delivery Push**: Tesla is reportedly gearing up for a big quarter-end delivery push, asking workers to help deliver 30,000 vehicles during the last two weeks of the quarter.

Overall, the article suggests that Musk's behavior is putting pressure on him, particularly with regards to his tweets and Tesla's production numbers. The SEC's demands for pre-approval of tweets could be a significant challenge for Musk, who has been accused of being reckless in his communication about Tesla's business.
