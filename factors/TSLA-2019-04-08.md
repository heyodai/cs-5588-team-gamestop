It appears that there are several articles related to Lyft (LYFT) stock and its future prospects. Here's a summary of the main points:

1. **Lyft IPO**: The article discusses the potential for Lyft's stock price to rise after its initial public offering (IPO). It highlights the company's growing share of overall transportation spend and estimates that it could take 5% of annual personal transportation costs in the US, generating $60 billion in bookings annually.
2. **Consumer behavior shift**: To achieve this growth, consumers would need to significantly change their behavior, using Lyft more regularly as an essential part of their commute. This shift would require a material portion of US consumers to give up their cars and choose Lyft over traditional transportation methods.
3. **Autonomous vehicles**: The article mentions the potential impact of autonomous vehicles on the ridesharing industry, but notes that self-driving cars may not be necessary for Lyft's growth. Instead, consumer choice and the economics of ridesharing could drive up usage and revenue.
4. **Patient investors needed**: The author suggests that investors should be patient and watch Lyft's numbers closely to see if the trend toward ridesharing is accelerating. If it doesn't, LYFT might have a problem.
