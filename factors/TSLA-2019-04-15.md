The article discusses the author's skepticism about investing in Initial Public Offerings (IPOs) from companies like Lyft and Uber, which are known for losing money. The author believes that these companies are not yet profitable and that investors who buy shares of their IPOs may be taking a risk. They suggest that companies should not go public without achieving GAAP profitability in the latest fiscal year, and that investors should focus on buying shares from companies that are more likely to be profitable.

The article also mentions that some early-stage investors do hold onto their shares for an extended period after going public, but notes that these exceptions are few and far between. The author concludes by saying that if they were the SEC, they would heed their words and require companies to achieve GAAP profitability before listing on a public market.

The article also mentions other investment opportunities, such as buying shares from companies like Levi Strauss, which has made money since its IPO. The author suggests that investors should focus on companies that are more likely to be profitable, rather than taking risks on companies that are known for losing money.

Overall, the article is a cautionary tale about investing in IPOs from companies that are not yet profitable, and encourages readers to do their research before making investment decisions.
