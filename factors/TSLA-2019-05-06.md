The article discusses the challenges facing Tesla, a leading electric car maker, and its stock price. The main points are:

1. **SEC regulations**: The US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is investigating Tesla's CEO Elon Musk for potential regulatory infractions, which could lead to serious consequences for the company.
2. **Q1 earnings results**: Tesla reported a quarterly loss of $2.90 per share and a revenue drop of 37%, citing "seasonality" as the reason for lower demand for its Model S and X vehicles during the winter months.
3. **Short-term technical analysis**: The stock's daily moves are described as rollercoaster-like, with a 52-week price range of $231.13 - $387.46. The short-term technical chart is weak, pointing to potential downside movement in the coming weeks.
4. **Long-term support**: Tesla has longer-term support in the low to mid-$200's, which may explain recent price gains as part of a relief rally.
