The article discusses Tesla's financial struggles and the potential for its stock price to plummet. The author highlights several concerns, including:

1. Tesla's debt: The company has $16 billion in debt and owes another $11 billion to Panasonic.
2. Credit market closure: The credit market is closed to Tesla, making it difficult for the company to raise funds.
3. Share price decline: Tesla's stock price has been declining, which can trigger margin calls and force sellers of the stock.
4. High short interest: The article notes that many investors are betting against Tesla's stock, creating an "idea situation" where the stock could bounce back.

The author also emphasizes the importance of distinguishing between the value of a brand (Tesla) and its stock price. While Musk has done a great job marketing the Tesla image, there is no guarantee that the stock will retain value.

The article concludes by stating that Tesla's financial struggles are real and that investors should be aware of the potential risks, including the possibility of TSLA stock plummeting to $10 or even lower.

However, the article also mentions that some investors are optimistic about Tesla's prospects, citing the company's efforts to reduce costs and increase efficiency. The author notes that while there is decent reason to think TSLA stock can recover, there is no guarantee.

Overall, the article presents a nuanced view of Tesla's financial situation, highlighting both the challenges the company faces and the potential for recovery.
