The European Commission (EC) has launched a 100 million-euro Breakthrough Energy Ventures fund to advance the energy transition, which includes battery production. The fund aims to build capacity for battery storage devices in Europe, with the goal of creating a supply chain that can meet the region's growing demand for electric vehicles.

The EC estimates that by 2025, Europe may control 11% of global battery cell manufacturing capacity, up from 4% now. This would pare back China's market share and rival the US command of the industry. The goal is to build enterprises in Europe that can supply automakers without requiring imports from Asian manufacturers.

Several European companies, including Peugeot SA, Total SA, and Siemens AG, are already investing in battery production, with a total commitment of at least 100 billion euros. The EC has also gathered over 260 industrial companies in an alliance aimed at building capacity to make energy storage devices in Europe.

The EU's push for battery production is driven by the need to reduce dependence on Asian manufacturers and create jobs in the automotive sector. Germany, in particular, is leading the charge, with Economy and Energy Minister Peter Altmaier focusing on creating 800,000 jobs tied directly to car manufacturing.

NorthVolt, a Swedish company, is planning to build a gigafactory that will supply batteries for BMW and other major automakers. The CEO has stated that the company needs to build about 150 gigawatt-hours of capacity by 2030 to become one of the major manufacturers in Europe.

The European Battery Alliance, led by EU Commission Executive Director-General Miguel Sefcovic, aims to coordinate research and development efforts that will form the foundation of the plan. The alliance is seeking to create a supply chain for rare Earth metals needed for batteries.

Overall, the EC's push for battery production in Europe is seen as an effort to reduce dependence on Asian manufacturers and create jobs in the automotive sector. The initiative is also driven by the need to advance the energy transition and reduce greenhouse gas emissions.
