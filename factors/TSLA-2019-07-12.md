Tesla stock has seen significant gains since early June, with a gain of over 23% compared to the Nasdaq Composite index's 8.9%. This is largely due to the company's efforts to increase production at its Fremont, California assembly plant and hiring new workers in Fremont and Nevada. Additionally, Tesla is poised to open its Gigafactory 3 in China later this year, which will produce the Model 3 at a 50% lower cost.

While risks remain, including concerns about profitability and the economic slowdown, analyst estimates have improved, with profit expectations now standing at $1.68 per share for 2019 and $5.05 per share for 2020. The company's forward price-to-earnings (PE) ratio is around 46.5, and profit growth is projected to average 114.3% per year over the next five years.

However, investors should be mindful of risks such as the current economic expansion, recession talk, and the trade war between the US and China. Additionally, Tesla's unique risk factor is CEO Elon Musk's eccentric behavior, which can impact the company's stability.

Despite these risks, TSLA stock looks poised to continue its recovery, with significant growth potential and a viable path to profitability. With record auto production and plans to ramp up production and hiring, Tesla appears to be on track to set new highs sooner rather than later.

In conclusion, while investors should remain cautious, the improving analyst estimates and Tesla's efforts to increase production and hire more workers suggest that TSLA stock may continue its upward trend.
