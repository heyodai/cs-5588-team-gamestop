The article is an interview with a venture capitalist who has invested in Tesla and other cleantech companies. Here are the main points from the conversation:

* The venture capitalist, Eckhouse, got his start in H&Q, which later became JPMorgan Chase, and was involved in environmental investing early on.
* The idea of a "double-bottom-line" impact fund came about when community groups in the Bay Area approached the Bay Area Council to invest in companies that could create jobs while also addressing environmental issues.
* Tesla was one of the first companies that Eckhouse invested in, and he helped aid the company's search for a factory location. He remembers being excited about the potential of electric cars at the time, but acknowledges that it was a riskier investment.
* Despite some challenges during the 2007-2008 financial crisis, Tesla ultimately became a successful company, and Eckhouse attributes their success to his early investment.
* Today, Eckhouse is still interested in cleantech investments, particularly in energy storage and conservation technologies. He believes that these technologies have the potential to reshape the grid and make a significant impact on reducing carbon emissions.

It's worth noting that the article does not mention any specific details about Eckhouse's personal life or his current investment portfolio beyond what is mentioned above.
