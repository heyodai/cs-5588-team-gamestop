2. **High executive turnover at Tesla**: Tesla's high turnover rate among top executives, particularly those close to Elon Musk, has raised concerns about stability and direction within the company.
3. **Rising short-seller gains**: Tesla is currently the most profitable short bet in US markets, with short-sellers having gained $2.98 billion year-to-date as of August 12.
4. **Economic recession fears**: Fresh fears of an economic recession have led to a slump in auto stocks and the US equity market, which may negatively impact Tesla's stock price.

These factors suggest that investors are becoming increasingly bearish on Tesla's stock, driven by concerns about the company's high executive turnover, rising short-seller gains, and declining demand for electric vehicles in China.
