Here are the top 5 factors that may affect the stock price of TSLA (Tesla):

1. **Competition from Toyota's Hydrogen Fuel Cell Sedan**: Toyota's new hydrogen fuel cell sedan could potentially challenge Tesla as a leader in electric vehicles, leading to a decline in demand for Tesla's products and a subsequent drop in its stock price.
2. **Increased Competition from Electric Vehicle Startups**: The growing number of electric vehicle startups, such as NIO and Byton, may lead to increased competition for Tesla, making it more difficult for the company to maintain its market share and leading to a decline in its stock price.
3. **Dyson's Abandonment of Electric Car Project**: Dyson's decision to abandon its electric car project due to the lack of commercial viability could be seen as a negative indicator for the entire industry, leading to a decline in investor confidence and a subsequent drop in Tesla's stock price.
4. **Record Q3 Deliveries Short of Musk's Target**: Tesla's record Q3 deliveries fell short of Elon Musk's target of 100,000 vehicles, which may lead to concerns about the company's sales growth and profitability, causing its stock price to decline.
5. **PG&E Blackout Impact on Charging Infrastructure**: The impact of PG&E's blackout on Tesla's charging infrastructure in Northern California could lead to a decline in investor confidence and a subsequent drop in Tesla's stock price if it affects the company's ability to provide reliable services to its customers.

Note that these factors may have varying degrees of impact on Tesla's stock price, and individual investors should consider their own risk tolerance and investment goals before making any decisions.
