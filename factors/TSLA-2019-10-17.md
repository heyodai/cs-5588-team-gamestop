Based on the provided news articles, here are the top 5 factors that may affect the stock price of TSLA:

1. **Relief Rally after Q3 Delivery Disappointment**: The current rally in Tesla's stock has been catalyzed by a relief rally after its third-quarter delivery disappointment. This could indicate that investors have taken a positive view of Tesla's ability to recover from past setbacks.
2. **Tesla's Manufacturing Approval in China**: Tesla's recent approval to start manufacturing in China is a significant development for the company. This could lead to increased demand for Tesla's products in the Chinese market, potentially driving up stock prices.
3. **Job Hopping and Employee Turnover**: A recent analysis by Business Journal shows that employees at large Silicon Valley tech employers like Facebook, Cisco, Apple, and Intel typically stay with the company for just over 2.5 years. This could indicate a potential issue with talent retention and management at Tesla, which may impact its stock price.
4. **Investor Sentiment and Value Investing**: A recent article highlighting signs of value investing suggests that investors are looking beyond growth stocks like Netflix to more undervalued companies. While this doesn't directly affect TSLA, it could indicate a shift in investor sentiment towards more conservative investment strategies.
5. **Earnings Expectations and Market Performance**: With Tesla's earnings coming up next week, investors will be closely watching the company's performance. A strong earnings report could boost stock prices, while a disappointing report may lead to sell-offs.
