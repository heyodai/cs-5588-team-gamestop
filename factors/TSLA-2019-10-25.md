The article discusses the recent price increase of Tesla's China-made cars, which have been released in the country. According to the article, the prices of these cars are expected to be higher than initially anticipated, with the base model starting at $50,000, only 3% less than the cheapest imported Model 3s.

This is surprising because Chinese customers had hoped that the locally produced cars would be significantly cheaper due to economies of scale and reduced production costs. However, Tesla has chosen to maintain its premium image in the market, which may affect the choices of some potential customers who are looking for more affordable options.

The article also mentions that Tesla will start delivering China-made models with Autopilot driver-assistance software as early as next year, which may further increase the prices. Additionally, the company has suspended website sales of a less expensive variant of the Model 3 without Autopilot, which was previously offered at $46,389.

Overall, the article suggests that Tesla's pricing strategy in China is intended to maintain its premium image and compete with local electric vehicle manufacturers such as NIO Inc. and BYD Co., which offer more affordable options.
