Based on the article, here are some key points to consider when evaluating Tesla's (TSLA) stock:

1. **Strong delivery and profit numbers**: Tesla's strong Q3 earnings results confirm its position as a leader in the electric vehicle market.
2. **Price target**: The author estimates that Tesla's price target is around $800 by 2030, with a reasonable 2019 price target of just under $310.
3. **Growth potential**: The company's strong growth prospects and sizable positive margin catalysts indicate that its profits will grow rapidly over the next decade.
