The article discusses Ford's latest move to revamp its product lineup with the launch of the Mustang Mach-E, an all-electric sport utility vehicle. The company is relying on this car to charge its turnaround efforts, which have been marred by profit warnings, quality problems, and a troubled launch of the Ford Explorer.

Key points from the article:

* The Mustang Mach-E has become a high-profile test for Ford's restructuring efforts.
* The company had initially struggled with designing a Mustang-inspired vehicle, but the pressure to deliver a Mustang-like experience increased when executives showed design concepts to small teams working on the project.
* Engineers faced significant challenges in translating fossil-fuel fury into clean-running power from lithium-ion batteries.
* The Mach-E features electric motors, which provide immediate thrust and allow for an even weight distribution, creating a low-slung ride similar to a Mustang.
* Ford claims that the Mach-E can beat a Porsche Macan SUV from 0-60 miles per hour and is close to a Porsche 911 GTS in terms of performance.
* The company has a tunable technology system to create an "authentic" sound, which should appeal to those missing the roar of a big V8 engine.
* LMC Automotive predicts that the Mustang Mach-E will top out around 50,000 sales annually by 2021.
* Ford's focus on performance aims to make the Mach-E a compelling alternative to Tesla's Model 3 sedan and other electric vehicle options.

Overall, the article suggests that the Mustang Mach-E is a critical component of Ford's turnaround efforts, with the company relying on its appeal, specifications, and design to overcome its competitors in the electric vehicle sector.
