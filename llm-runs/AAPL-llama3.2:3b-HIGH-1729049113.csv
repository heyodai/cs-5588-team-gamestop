2018-01-02,42.54,SELL,50,3177.0,50,1050,"Despite Piper Jaffray's bullish outlook, the uncertainty around iPhone sales and the challenge in growing high-end smartphone market share, as well as the potential acquisition of Netflix, seem to outweigh the positive predictions. I'm taking a cautious approach given my high risk tolerance."
2018-01-03,43.13,BUY - Insufficient funds,1000,3177.0,50,1050,"The strong demand for chips and consumer electronics, as well as Apple's reported cash reserves, suggest a bullish outlook for AAPL. Additionally, global chip sales hitting a record and Qorvo Inc.'s stock dropping may indicate a trend in the industry that could positively impact AAPL. Given my high portfolio risk tolerance, I believe it is reasonable to increase my stake in AAPL by buying 1000 more shares."
2018-01-04,43.13,SELL,5,2996.07,45,1055,"Given the high portfolio risk tolerance and the recent disclosure of security flaws in Intel chips used by AAPL, I believe selling a portion of my shares may be a prudent decision to mitigate potential losses. The Meltdown and Spectre bugs have the potential to significantly impact device performance and user confidence, which could negatively affect AAPL's stock price. By selling 5 shares, I am taking a cautious approach to manage risk while still considering the possibility that AAPL's stock price may recover."
2018-01-05,43.36,SELL,20,2159.0,25,1075,"Given the high portfolio risk tolerance and recent disclosure of chip flaws affecting Apple's products, I'm concerned about potential security risks and potential decline in stock price. The available patches do not protect users immediately, which could lead to short-term losses. However, considering the measures people can take to mitigate harm and the overall importance of keeping software up-to-date, I don't want to hold on to my shares for an extended period. Selling 20 shares will allow me to lock in some gains while still maintaining a substantial portion of my portfolio."
2018-01-08,43.59,SELL,5,1951.75,20,1080,"Given the high risk tolerance and current valuation of $2159.000025 per share, I'm concerned that the issues with smartphone addiction, wireless earbuds, and technology platform war may negatively impact AAPL's stock price. Selling 5 shares will allow me to lock in some profits while keeping my overall portfolio exposure relatively low."
2018-01-09,43.64,SELL,5,1739.56,15,1085,"Given Apple's large cash reserves and potential for a buyback, I'm concerned about the possibility of decreased stock value if repurchases occur. Additionally, concerns about iPhone addiction may lead to increased scrutiny on the company's product development. Considering my HIGH risk tolerance, I decide to sell 5 shares to potentially capitalize on any potential short-term gains."
2018-01-10,43.29,SELL,10,1311.45,5,1095,"The battery issues discussed in several articles may negatively impact Apple's reputation and stock performance.

Selling 10 shares will allow me to adjust my portfolio and respond to market fluctuations."
2018-01-11,43.65,HOLD,0,1311.45,5,1095,No significant favorable or unfavorable factors were mentioned in the article that would justify a buy or sell decision. The current valuation and high portfolio risk tolerance lead me to maintain my current position.
2018-01-12,44.04,SELL,5,1100.0,0,1100,"Despite Apple's recent success, the volatility in the Dow 30 stock index and potential loopholes in the new US tax law may impact AAPL's price. Additionally, concerns about data storage requirements for Chinese users could also affect investor sentiment. I'm selling 5 shares to diversify my portfolio and minimize potential losses."
2018-01-16,44.47,BUY - Insufficient funds,50,1100.0,0,1100,"Despite concerns about slowing iPhone battery issues and leadership failures, I believe Apple's strong brand and innovative product pipeline will help mitigate these risks. Additionally, the growing adoption of 3D sensing technology in smartphones presents an opportunity for AAPL to gain a competitive edge. With a high risk tolerance, I'm willing to take a larger position to ride out potential volatility."
